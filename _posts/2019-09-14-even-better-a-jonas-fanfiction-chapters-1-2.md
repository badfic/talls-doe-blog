Even Better

Chapter one

. . . . . . . .

Seeing her every day would be even better if I didn’t have to see the way *he* looked at her. He loved his brother, don’t get him wrong. His brother was someone he really looked up to, even though he was pretty sure that-if someone asked-his brother might say the same thing about him. Even though he was younger, the youngest to be exact. At least, he hoped his brother looked up-or down-to him like he did to him. He just wished they didn’t look at the same girl in the same way.

He had already been pegged as the sensitive one, so he wasn’t going to try to sweep the girl his brother wanted off her feet. That wasn’t his style. Even though it killed him to watch his older, the oldest to be exact, brother’s lips twist into a smile every time he saw her. Even with all the injuries she caused, he still had that same look on his face every time she walked into view. It was heartbreaking to say the least.

“Hi Kevin,” She said, returning his smile with something that looked manufactured and nervous before tagging, “of JONAS.” of her greeting. Kevin’s smile always faltered at that. He was torn, he knew Macy adored him, but he didn’t know if she adored him because of the band he was in or because of the person he was.

“Hi Macy,” he said, returning her greeting, counting out how long she had paused before adding the “of JONAS” to the end and giving her the same courtesy by adding, “of school.” to the end of his greeting. Macy swooned, the “of school” comment wasted on her as she swung her hockey stick in such a way that it almost made contact with the side of Nick’s face. Nick, being apt to her klutzy ways, ducked it with ease.

“Hi, Nick,” Macy said next, same swooning fangirl smile on her face. Nick sighed, waiting for her to add the “of JONAS” to the end of his greeting. She didn’t.

“Hi, Macy,” he responded after a long moment of silence. She smiled at him, but it wasn’t the same smile she had given Kevin. It was then, at this moment, that he knew he didn’t have a chance with her. Kevin already got her best smiles, her first greeting…He guessed it was for the best, Macy deserved someone like Kevin and Kevin deserved someone like Macy.

Nick Lucas, always the martyr.

He watched in dismay as Macy turned back to Kevin, almost whacking him in the face with her hockey stick *again*. Luckily he dodged it. Again. And neither of them noticed that he had just narrowly avoided getting hit. They were too busy laughing about something he had missed out on hearing when he was dodging her hockey stick and recovering from the initial shock of almost being knocked out.

A second later, he checked his watch, waved to them and stalked off down the hallway. It was painful standing there and watching his brother and the girl he wanted flirt. This wasn’t like Maria and not just because Joe wasn’t involved this time. Macy was their friend, a girl they had known longer, a girl they had formed connections with. This one hurt more, but Nick, being the sensitive one and knowing that his brother had been interested in her first-at least, he had mentioned his interested in Macy first-so he took a back seat and watched his worst nightmare begin to unfold.

Around the corner he ran into Stella and Joe. They were talking about something he wasn’t close enough to hear yet and holding some kind of orangey colored fliers. He had never been so relieved to see them in his life.

“Hey, Nick,” Stella said, handing him a flier. Nick took it and looked down at in in confusion.

“What this?” He asked, looking back up and directly at Stella.

“Some kind of Cinderella ball,” Joe said, flipping his hair and rolling his eyes, “Stella conned me into helping her out.”

“It’s a costume party slash masquerade slash Cinderella tribute!” Stella said excitedly, handing a few more kids that passed by a flier before leaning close to say, “And I hear JONAS might perform,” very loudly into his ear so everyone around them could hear as well.

“Where’d you hear that?” Joe and Nick asked together, surprised that she would insist they perform without their permission.

“From me,” she responded, smirking. Nick looked down at the flier and checked the date. Lucky for Stella, they would be in town then. But she already knew that, she went with them on all their appearances. After all, what was a band without their stylist?

“I dunno, Stells,” Joe piped up, “I think we might be out of town that weekend.” Stella shot Joe a glare.

“I know your schedule, moron,” she responded, pointing to herself with her free hand, “Stella Malone, stylist to JONAS, remember?” Joe grumbled something under his breath and rolled his eyes again.

“What if we went on a family vacation that weekend?” Joe asked, obviously getting ready to spark and argument between them. Stella glared at him, one hand on her hip. Nick took that cue to check his watch again and point down the hallway, walking in the direction he pointed.

He really needed to find something to get his mind off of Macy and writing a song just wasn’t going to cut it this time.

. . . . . . . . .

I’m going for fairy tale here. I really am. I’ve got another one I’m writing that is fairy tale-esque as well. Sorry for the kind of angsty beginning. I feel bad for Nick. It’s like, Joe and Stella have the hots for each other and Macy and Kevin like each other. Who does Nick get? This makes me sad.

Woo! I’m updating! I feel so alive! It’s been a crazy few days, truthfully. I went to see Transformers and it was *great*!

And because I think my anon reviewer xxxx might read this, “Yo, what’s up? Thanks for the reviews. I contacted Dramatic Starlet for ya, she was ecstatic. You’re really nice =). Just next time, you don’t have to shout out, tell me and I’ll do it. It’s not that hard. Seeing as how most of the JONAS authors know each other. Peace!”

I’m done now. I swear.

Even Better

Chapter Two

. . . . . . . . .

An hour into study hall and he was still having a hard time thinking of something *other* than the cute little brunette he had accidentally fallen for. Okay, so maybe it wasn’t *technically* an accident? Can anything really be an accident? Nick Lucas was a firm believer in the “everything happens for a reason” theory. There was a push and a pull to these types of things. Maybe he had to learn a lesson, or maybe he was reading into his feelings too much. Maybe he just wanted to be friends with Macy.

*Yeah*, Nick thought bitterly, *That’s why I write songs about her and feel a pain in my chest every time I see her with Kevin.*He took a deep breath just as the bell rang. He stood up, relieved and torn up inside at the same time. Maybe he needed another theory.

Being back in the hallway again, was like a mental struggle. He noticed that everything was set up again. Macy and Kevin were having a conversation and Stella and Joe were passing out posters. He didn’t know who he didn’t want to talk to more. The bickering couple-in-the-making that was in denial or the couple-in-the-making that wasn’t in denial or bickering. He decided that neither might be a good choice and continued on down the hallway, hoping none of them would notice as he stalked off to his next class.

“Hey Nick,” Stella said as he walked past she and Joe.

*So much for hoping*, he thought as he turned around and smiled at his older brother’s best friend.

“Yeah, Stella?” He asked, keeping his usual neutral expression.

“Can you help us out?” She motioned from herself to Joe and then back to herself as she said that. Nick raised an eyebrow to show his interest.

“Sure,” Nick said, even though he would really rather be in his next class, sitting alone and waiting for his teacher to get there so he could focus on something else other than Macy for *at least* ten minutes. “What’s up?”

“Well,” Stella began, giving a big elaborate explanation of another one of she and Joe’s arguments while Nick pretended to listen. “So, I’m right, right?” She asked as soon as she was finished, Nick cleared his throat, snapping back to reality and out of his ever-constant thoughts of Macy.

“Yeah,” Nick said, shooting his brother an apologetic look, “Stella, you’re always right.” Stella turned and have Joe an “I told you so” smile. Joe glared at his younger brother.

“Come on!” Joe said, “Nick *always* says that, he *always* tells you that you’re right. You know that.”

“Duh,” Stella said, “why do you think I always ask him?” Joe stared at her in mock shock, his hand flying to his chest.

“Stella Malone,” he said in a fake southern accent, gasping before fanning himself, “I am surprised at you!”

“Can it, Lucas,” Stella remarked, before turning back to Nick and giving him the sweetest smile she could muster. “Thank you, Nick,” she said, winking before she added, “you were *always* my favorite!”

“Hey!” Joe said from behind her, “What about me?” Stella turned to face him again.

“You’re my *least* favorite,” she remarked, glowering at him.

“I’m hurt, Stella,” Joe said, “Just plain *hurt*. I thought I was your best friend.” Nick took this as his cue to leave, trying to duck past where Macy and Kevin were giving each other googly eyes without them noticing him.

“Nick!” His older brother called out to him as he was trying to rush by. Nick stopped for a second, closing his eyes and praying silently that he had imagined Kevin calling him before he looked over.

*Crap*, Nick thought, watching in disdain as Kevin waved him over.

“Hey, Kev,” Nick said, his voice cracking a little as he made his way over. Macy smiled at him and he felt his heart skip a beat. “What’s up?” He watched out of the corner of his eye as Macy’s smile faltered when he didn’t acknowledge her. He wished she could understand it was for the best.

“Kevin just asked me to that Cinderella ball thing that Stella is throwing,” Macy squealed, obviously not too upset by him not saying hey to her. Nick’s mouth twitched slightly as he forced his lips to curl up into an enthusiastic smile.

“That’s great!” He said, feeling as if his heart had not only shattered, but had been ground into fine powder and was now being used to suffocate him. Macy giggled and Kevin smiled at her. Nick punched his brother’s arm playfully. “Took ya long enough, huh?” He asked, winking. Kevin blushed at that and Macy giggled again. Inwardly, Nick sighed.

“Thanks,” Macy said after a few seconds of awkward silence, smiling in Nick’s direction again.

“For what?” Nick asked.

“For the congratulations,” Macy said, raising an eyebrow.

“Oh,” Nick said, flashing her another smile, “that.” Then he did what he did earlier, he checked his watch and started to walk off.

“Where are you going?” Macy asked, reaching out to touch his arm. Nick bit his lip and closed his eyes tight. Then, regaining his composure he turned around to face Macy and Kevin once more.

“I don’t want to be late for Math,” he informed them, “Yay decimals.”

“But you hate your Math class,” Kevin said. Nick’s mouth twitched again.

“I changed my mind,” he said, “bye guys.” With that he was gone, walking down the hallway at a high rate of speed. He was beginning to feel the same way Joe did about this whole Cinderella Ball thing. It really was a stupid idea.

. . . . . . . .

I swear to bob that my iTunes started playing “Bleeding Love” right at the moment when I was typing the “Kevin just asked me to the Cinderella Ball” part. Isn’t that trippy? Anyways, more emo!Nick. Hopefully we’ll get to the Cinderella Ball soon. I’m *so* looking forward to it!
