Insignificant  
Nobody  
Useless  
Worthless  
Broken  
and wait for. the. rest.  
a sea of words  
to describe the pain  
of realizing there’s  
no one left  
who wouldn’t discard you  
a sea of pain  
for a second, a minute, an hour…  
*a lifetime*  
of. an. endless. sea.  
and hoping maybe someday  
you wont feel as  
Empty  
Despised  
Forgotten  
Ugly  
Invisible
