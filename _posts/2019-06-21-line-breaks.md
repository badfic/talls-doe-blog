I’m caught  
in these lines,  
stanzas, versus,  
lyrics  
because they  
remind me how  
broken, lonely  
in love  
I am.

I read  
them so often  
it almost  
hurts  
they always  
tell me who  
I am  
or was  
long ago.

Even now  
my words have  
the ability  
to  
break someone’s  
heart on contact  
to show  
love and  
hate – red.

They overtake  
my memories of  
a happier  
time  
and make  
them seem less  
important than  
the times  
of sadness.

I wish  
I could find  
my way  
out  
of this  
labyrinth of dark  
words and  
unhappy moments  
in life.
