We’re on different sides of the   
**spectrum**:

> a range or scale of anything such as opinions or emotions

it doesn’t make sense  
these words rushing through my  
**heart**:

> this definition is relative

i don’t remember the last time i thought  
in waves of color, blending   
break*ing*,  
i don’t remember the last time  
there was time or patience  
or forgiveness  
least of all *love*.

Our differences are **relative**  
they tell me we’re the same  
but “they” are **relative**  
my thoughts are disrupted  
by silence  
and for the first time  
i wish there wasn’t this endless  
**second**:

> time passing by. an increment. measurement.

where all i think, thought, speak about is you  
it has been a long time since i’ve felt the  
*special* kind of  
**numb**:

> lack of feeling

**-ness**  
where all it is—  
is your soft whispers  
and excited tingles on my skin.

Someone once told me  
that “opposites attract”  
but i don’t think of *us*  
(<sub>which by our terms, is relative</sub>)  
as “opposites” or  
“the same”  
similarities and opposites are  
“relative”.

I asked you once, twice  
*more times than I can count, actually*  
what you defined “us” as  
and every time i asked, the answer was  
**different**:

> <sub>its a contrast, contradiction </sub>

but as of late, its defined as  
**special**.

It’s been a long time since  
i’ve felt unbr-*oken*, a full  
spectrum of light  
shining through   
glass.
