TW: sexual assault, child abuse

We’re moving and it’s dark and warm  
I feel safe, but only until we stop  
the fear sets in and I  
c  
a  
n  
’t  
scream because of the **tape**  
and I can’t  
r  
u  
n  
because…

The trunk opens   
and light pours into my  
**safe darkness**  
and I’m not *safe*  
or alone…  
anymore.

I squint, blinded by the bright lights  
and I can’t see his face, but I know  
it’s a question they’ll ask later  
at the hospital.

They’ll also ask what he did to me  
where he touched me  
if he hurt me  
at least…  
that’s what happens on TV.

On TV they always catch the bad guy.

His hands are on me and  
I’m scared, I don’t want him to touch me  
but everything is going so fast  
his arms hold me as I struggle  
and he tells me “it’ll be quick”  
because he only “likes ‘em live the first time”  
**I feel sick**.

He takes me in a house  
it’s dirty and dust is everywhere  
it smells like old books and rotting wood  
there’s one mattress  
and I know that’s where   
I  
’m

g  
o  
i  
n  
g.

Still fast. He throws me down, tells me  
“struggle all you want, I’m stronger than you”  
and I know it’s true because he’s on top of me  
a bundle of free, flailing limbs and he pins me.

His teeth are yellow and his  
breath smells like coffee and alcohol  
he tells me “I like ’em young”  
I don’t respond, still flailing.

He’s wearing glasses and his cheeks are red  
and his eyes are black as coal, his nose has a wart  
and he got Star too, but she didn’t make it because…  
*he likes younger girls better*.

Star is a year older and  
when he asked us our ages he seemed like  
such a nice man.

He gave us balloons and told us we were  
p **p***p* p  
r **r***r* r  
e **e***e* e  
t **t***t* t  
t **t***t* t  
y **y***y* y  
and every little girl wants to be pretty  
*just. like. mommy*.

He made me watch when he touched her  
up her skirt, over her legs  
he told me not to look away  
because it made him hot to know I was watching  
I couldn’t stop crying when she screamed  
he was hurting her by…

His lips are all over my body and it burns  
the hatred in me and I…I can’t stop screaming  
he’s touching me and using fingers and whispering  
“You’re my good girl, you’re my good girl”  
I’m sick. I’m sick.

He wont stop touching me   
and he tells me “this’ll hurt a little”  
and he tells me “I like it when you scream”  
and he tells me “you’re so pretty”  
and he tells me “a perfect little angel”  
and he tells me “so innocent”  
and I’m not anymore  
I’m not and I…  
I  
I’m  
not and….  
I can’t stop screaming  
because it hurts  
and I’m not old enough  
and

He tells me “I only like ’em live the first time”.
