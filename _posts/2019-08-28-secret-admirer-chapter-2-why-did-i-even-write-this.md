Secret Admirer

Disclaimer:*I don’t own JONAS.*

Author’s Notes:*Well, here’s the second chapter finally :). Hope you guys like it.*

. . . . . . .

Macy poked her head around the corner of the wall that her locker was on. She was hoping to catch her secret admirer in the act, but with her luck the hallway was practically empty. Well, other than the students loitering around them who were avoiding going to their next class right away for whatever reason. She sighed, coming around the corner and making her way to her locker. She did the combination and opened it, watching as another note fluttered from the door to fall at her feet. She couldn’t help but smile as she bent down and picked it up and read it over before putting it in her pocket.

Then she exchanged the books and equipment she had for different ones and slammed her locker shut. And with that same goofy smile on her face, she made her way down the hallway to her next class. It was just her luck, again, however, when she ran into another member of JONAS while coming around the same corner where she had been spying on her locker. She was so surprised, she dropped her bowling ball on his foot.

Nick Lucas, the youngest of the members of JONAS winced and cried out on pain. Macy was trying to concentrate on breathing, feeling the familiar sensation of panic and obsession.

“I’m so sorry!” She blurted, bending down to pick up the ball, only to hit her head against his as he bent down at the same time to help her. Nick straightened up then, staring down at Macy as she scrambled to pick up the bowling ball and one of the books she dropped. As he watched he noticed that there was a piece of green paper sticking out of her back pocket. He smiled softly, waiting for her to get to her feet.

“What’s in your back pocket?” He asked. Macy blushed.

“It’s nothing,” she said, still trying to concentrate on her breathing.

“You can tell me,” he told her, flashing her a smile. Macy’s heart thundered in her chest and she felt like-

Nick almost gasped when he saw her start to fall backwards. Thinking quickly, he reached out and grabbed her before she could hurt herself. However, the bowing ball she was holding, did manage to fall on his foot. Again. At such a great time. Nick watched, annoyed with himself as the shock of having a bowling ball dropped on his foot made him let go of Macy, dropping her on the floor. Which was exactly what he didn’t want to happen.

“What happened?” Stella asked as she walked up to him upon seeing her best friend laid out on the floor. Nick glanced up at her with a “are you seriously asking me that” look on his face.

“You’re right,” Stella said, “stupid question.”

“Let’s just get her to the nurse,” Nick said, stepping back so that he could grab Macy’s feet and watching as Stella grabbed her arms. “On three?” Nick asked. Stella nodded. “One, two…”

“Wait,” Stella said. Nick stopped counting and looked at her.

“What?” He asked.

“Aren’t you strong enough to lift her by yourself?” Stella asked.

“Yeah…” Nick said and Stella let go of Macy’s arms, putting a hand on her hip, “It’d be easier if you help me.”

“Someone needs to get her stuff out of the middle of the hallway,” Stella explained, “That’d still be considered helping.”

“Okay,” Nick said, feeling stupid for not having noticed that before, “Get her stuff and I’ll carry her.”

“Okay,” Stella said, picking up the stuff Macy had dropped in the hallway while Nick picked her up, holding her in his arms princess-style. He had to smile again, staring down at the girl he held in his arms. She looked so cute when she was passed out it was almost unreal. “What’re you smiling about?” Stella asked, snapping him out of his admiration of the cute brunette he held in his arms.

“I just remembered something funny,” he said, starting to walk in the direction of the nurse’s office. Stella arched an eyebrow at him before bending down to pick up the folded over green note and opening it. She noticed it was another note from Macy’s secret admirer. It wasn’t totally an invasion of privacy if she was trying to be a good friend, right?

After all, she wanted to know just as bad as Macy did. And that handwriting did look really familiar.

Ending Notes:*Yay. A moment with Nick! =). EDIT: Fixed the random “up her” and calling Nick, Joe. Thanks thiscoffeeshop and solitaire42 for pointing that out!*
