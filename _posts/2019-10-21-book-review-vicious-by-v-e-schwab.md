I have no idea why it took me so long to discover V.E Schwab especially because the kinds of books she writes are the kinds of books I read. And also she has the most enormous following of any author I’ve ever seen before in my life?

Vicious was fantastic. I love stories where there’s no real cut-and-dry hero or villain. This literally checked something off of every list of narrative stories I like. And siren characters like Serena are just…\*kisses fingers\* my favorite thing.

Honestly I’m so excited for the second one, but I’m taking a detour through A Darker Shade of Magic and the Cassidy Blake series first since I have some catching up to do before I meet her.

### More about [Vicious](https://amzn.to/2NsFhpU)

**A masterful tale of ambition, jealousy, desire, and superpowers.**

Victor and Eli started out as college roommates—brilliant, arrogant, lonely boys who recognized the same sharpness and ambition in each other. In their senior year, a shared research interest in adrenaline, near-death experiences, and seemingly supernatural events reveals an intriguing possibility: that under the right conditions, someone could develop extraordinary abilities. But when their thesis moves from the academic to the experimental, things go horribly wrong.

Ten years later, Victor breaks out of prison, determined to catch up to his old friend (now foe), aided by a young girl whose reserved nature obscures a stunning ability. Meanwhile, Eli is on a mission to eradicate every other super-powered person that he can find—aside from his sidekick, an enigmatic woman with an unbreakable will. Armed with terrible power on both sides, driven by the memory of betrayal and loss, the archnemeses have set a course for revenge—but who will be left alive at the end?

In *Vicious*, V. E. Schwab brings to life a gritty comic-book-style world in vivid prose: a world where gaining superpowers doesn’t automatically lead to heroism, and a time when allegiances are called into question.
