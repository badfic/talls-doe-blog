i used to think that  
love was the way you said my name  
or the way that you  
smiled at me when we sat in silence

but now everything feels empty  
a shell of what we were  
the silence is deafening and  
every word is a dance

we are broken, unfixable   
the distance between us is insurmountable  
and i wish

wish

wish

but it never comes true
