I have a very special treat for you guys. From now until August 9th or so, I’ll be posting chapters of a fanfiction I wrote in 2005 containing Hannah Pettigrew, my Harry Potter OC who would eventually become the basis for Ophelia from my book, *Power*.   
  
The below has not been edited, beta’d, or updated to fit my current writing style.

**Secret Oblivion**

**-Chapter one-**

**Disclaimer: I own not Harry Potter, but own I do the OC: Hannah Pettigrew. My friend owns the OC that will come along later.**

**Summary: When Hannah becomes a death eater she peers into her future to see what will become of her life. When she sees Sirius become hurt, she vows to never let that happen, but will she remember the images in time to save everyone? SB/OC SS/OC JP/LP**

**A/N: First HP Fiction.**

“The Future”

For some doors open and opportunities file through, but for others nothing happens. They say graduating from Hogwarts is one of the best things that ever happens to you, but for Hannah Pettigrew…it would be the worst.

Hannah stretches out for another ordinary day. It had only been a few days since her graduation and she was quite unsure of what to do in her life. She opened the curtains of her muggle apartment and she stared out at all the muggles that walked by. Sometimes their actions would amuse her, but today she felt something was missing. It was like a part of her was gone. She stared at her forearm and traced her fingers over the dark mark. She was a newly recruited death eater, but it was nothing to be proud of. Her brother, Peter, had actually tricked her into it. The dirty little rat. Tears flooded her eyes and she started to sob helplessly.

“What would Sirius think?” She asked, her heart started to break. He would hate her! She turned from the window and closed the curtains. She stared at her table and took out some potion ingredients. She lay them on the table as the tears kept falling. She felt so ashamed! She read the recipe over and over. She needed it to be perfect.

By the time she had finished darkness was beginning to fall upon the muggle world. She held the potion up in the light and she opened her mouth, drinking deep. She fell onto the floor, in a deep sleep. She wanted to see what was to become of her future.

It took awhile for the future visions to start, she could see Sirius and her dating, being married, she was overcome with happiness, but the happiness wouldn’t last. The next scene caused her pain she saw Lily and James being killed, by her ‘Master’. The commotion was great and her face was filled with horror. She screamed, but nothing came. Her master turned and looked at her. His Words we’re clear,

“Bring me the babe.” Hannah tried to stop herself, but she couldn’t. She didn’t want them to live they didn’t deserve it. She hated this feeling! This feeling of hatred. And Towards her best friends from her years at Hogwarts. Was she destined to kill them? She picked up the baby and held it close to her, trying to shush the crying in fear of drawing attention of the muggle neighbors. Her master didn’t look pleased.

“Avarda Kendava,” He hissed, Hannah stared at him with fear, green light consumed them both, and she could feel herself dying. She struggled to wake up from the memories, but she couldn’t. They went on. She could see Peter staging his death in a muggle ally and she saw Sirius going to Azkaban for it. Her heart broke. Her brother was a rat; he would always be a dirty little rat! Rage consumed her as she tried to force herself out of these horrid images. Her master would kill her friends, their child, and even her! This was her future? She couldn’t let this happen.

Hannah opened her eyes to see the sun shining through her open curtains, and Sirius was standing over her.

“Oh ‘Annah!” He said, hugging her. She let out a squeak and struggled for air.

“Sirius…AIR!” She managed to choke out, he released her.

“Oh ‘Annah I’m so sorry! I was just so scared you weren’t going to pull through!” Hannah stared at him a few moments before she coughed miserably. Sirius held her to his chest in comfort. He was so warm, she felt like her body was going to melt into his. The visions that worried her so started to delete themselves from her mind, and she forgot everything. She even forgot how to breathe it seemed. Once the coughing stopped he let her go, but she didn’t want to move. He smiled knowingly and held her until the bread smelled like it was burning.

“Er ‘Anna…’Oney…the bread is burning…” Her eyes opened and he pushed away from him.

“Bread! Sirius you idiot!” She ran to the stove and opened it, the bread appeared to be in an okay condition. She looked back at Sirius and he laughed helplessly.

“You’re lucky this time Sirius Black!” She said angrily. Sirius held his ribs, still laughing. Hannah put a hand on her hip before noticing the pitcher of water on her kitchen table. She smirked and lifted it with the levitation spell; she pushed it slowly over the still laughing Sirius and jumped it on his face. A girlish shriek filled the room and he stood quickly. Hannah laughed this time.

“Aww is the puppy-wuppy afwaid of a little water?” She asked mockingly, tilting her head back and laughing harder. Sirius advanced on her, she felt his body against hers and the laughing stopped. He backed her up into the counter softly, his blue eyes locked with hers and she gulped. He moved in and her eyes closed gradually. She felt his lips press against hers gently, and his hands came up around her waist. Her own hands gripped his arms softly before moving higher and onto his shoulders. Her heart raced and her soul flew in the air around them. When he pulled away she smirked at him.

“If I would’ve known water did this to you…” she started, but he silenced her with another kiss. When he pulled back this time the two stood close together in complete silence. Neither wanted to ruin this moment. Hannah lay her head on his chest. The silence of the room didn’t bother either of them. They were happy to be in each other’s arms.
