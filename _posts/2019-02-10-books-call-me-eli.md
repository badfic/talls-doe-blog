All the stories are fantastic!

## More about Call Me Eli:

After his father’s passing, Eli Tremont struggles to find acceptance in his hometown of Appleton, WA due to him being transgender.

His step-mother, Clarice Tremont, would rather try to erase him from existence than accept him for who he is and his step-sisters, Anastasia and Nina, follow her primitive way of thinking.

There are only a few people in Appleton that are on his side; his best friend Kelly Baum and his boss Alex Gilroy. They’re the only people who even come close to understanding what he’s going through.

When Kelly (with Alex’s help) pushes Eli to go to Seattle for an impromptu summer iteration of CosFest, a costume festival he and Kelly have been going to together for years, Eli is against it. He would rather pull out his own teeth than risk angering his step-mother. Though, when he finds out Clarice and his step-sisters will be gone for the weekend, he goes without their knowledge.

However, there’s something Kelly isn’t telling him; there’s a reason why CosFest was rescheduled. Eli discovers this when the international superstar, and his step-sisters’ favorite musician, Dustin Lightning takes the stage and the purportedly enchanted evening quickly begins to unravel.
