For one night only–  
I’ll be who you want me to be  
lay on my back and look pretty  
say things to get your pitty  
for just one night

For one night only–  
I’ll let the smoke from my cigarette  
curl up and around your sweet face  
let your eyes water from the stench  
for just one night

For one night only–  
I’m offering, no strings attached  
No hope renewed, nothing gained  
*everything lost*  
for just one night

For one night only–  
I’ll tell you what you wanna hear  
whisper sweet nothings in your ear  
lies against my red-stained lips  
your head against my breast  
for just one night

For one night only–  
I’ll be her with the long red nails  
the short brown hair, red-stained lips  
high stiletto heals

And in the morning…  
you don’t even have to remember  
my name.
