I had a great time streaming for all of you! I probably lost my voice and streaming for this long was probably a bad idea, but I hope all of you enjoyed it!

No worries if you missed it, though because you can view it anytime on my channel by going [here](https://www.twitch.tv/wrenzday/videos)!

Thank you to everyone who showed up to support me. It was a blast! And donâ€™t forget to grab a copy of [Marjorie Book 2](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P86KDNM)!
