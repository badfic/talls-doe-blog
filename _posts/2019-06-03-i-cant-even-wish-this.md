You tell me that  
*I’m a wreck*  
but you’re the one who made me this way  
I’m *your wreck*.

So, fix me  
I want you to **bleed**  
for your transgressions  
I want you to *suffer*  
for the way you make me feel  
I want you to *fix me*.

You tell me that  
*I’m broken*  
but you’re the one who broke me  
I’m *your problem*.

So tape me back together,  
I want your fingers to **break**  
under the weight of your transgressions  
I want your lips to *bleed*  
for the secrets you make me keep  
I want you to *fix me*

You tell me that  
*I’m a waste of time*  
but you’re the one who wastes me  
I’m *your life flashing before your eyes*.

So rewind the tape,  
I want your eyes to **see**  
what you’ve done to me  
I want your heart to *break*  
for the way you left me  
I want you to *fix me*.

You tell me that  
*you’ll never love me*  
not even if I was the last girl on earth.
