Time passes through sand  
an hourglass, the slow fade of  
*f o r e v e r* and the   
**promise** of happy memories  
lost in the darkness of the   
s l o w f a d e  
and caught between the lines   
of imaginary numbers

We’re all wasting time here  
broken and empty, scattered across  
this ocean of regret   
we’re **running out of time**  
holding on by strings of shame  
and bitterness and doubt and  
maybe there’s still an ounce  
of humanity to this

Maybe  
s o m eday this  
whatever this is  
will be something  
maybe someday  
this  
….  
maybe some–
