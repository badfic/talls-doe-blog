There’s a pain I can’t ignore  
Because Earlier I got to thinkin’ “Maybe I can”  
but there’s things you don’t want to deal with  
so there in lies the problem  
to deny what love is  
transforms you to hate.

People are startin’ to worry  
that I’ll say good-bye to what I was  
now that I feel like this.

I’m talkin’ to him   
and askin’ him “Is this right?”   
but he’s tellin’ me “No”  
it don’t suprise me  
the answer was there all along.

I’m talkin’ to her  
but she don’t know the problem  
she don’t know what she’s about.

I don’t wanna say good-bye to yesterday  
because it lacks these complications  
the things I have to hide  
but maybe I can just say it isn’t there  
but there in lies the problem…  
because it is.
