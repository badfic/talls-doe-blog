“Stop Crying Your Heart Out”

Hannah lay there in pieces all night long. Even in the morning she didn’t have the strength to move. Depression made her feel like the sun would never shine again, but she didn’t ever bother to open the curtains and check if it was out there. She was wallowing in self-pity. This wasn’t very fitting for Hannah. She was usually the first to pick her friends up when they were down, but this was different. This was Hell on earth for her. She had lost the man she loved. All to a stupid mark!

Hannah glared at it, and she let out a resounding scream as she clawed at the hideous mark. No matter how much she bled, to matter how torn up her arm was it wouldn’t go away. More tears spilled from her eyes.

“This is all my fault,” she sobbed. A feeling of hatred for herself washed over her. She felt horrible and she didn’t want to feel like this anymore. She glared back down at the mark. Blood dripped from her cut arm, but the mark has taken over once more. It was in perfect condition like it was burned into her skin. Not only into it, but under it and in every part of her.

She had thought to cut off her arm, but the mark would probably just appear in another place. Her sobbing grew louder and louder until she finally fell asleep again. Even if it was the middle of the day she didn’t care. She had already lost the will to live so nothing mattered.

All of her friends from Hogwarts probably hated her for taking this mark, or at least the people who didn’t take the mark with her. Her eyes shot open as if she hadn’t been asleep at all, and a grin slid across her face. There were people who feared her as well as hated her in this world. None of them deserved to live. Not even her friends.

What was wrong with her? She shook her head rapidly until all the thoughts slipped from her mind. Her friends did deserve to live! Everyone deserved a chance at life. Where had she gotten this terrible idea?

Her mind drifted back to the visions and she gasped. She now understood why she had showed Sirius the mark. It was to protect him from what she would become, but how would she protect James and Lily from the Dark Lord? She thought for awhile before the answer finally came from the deepest part of her mind. *‘You can’t.’*

Hannah’s eyes filled with tears again. She flung herself back down onto her bed and sobbed.

“All of my stars…are fading away…” She said, the sobs came out harder. This was terrible. Her life was terrible, but she couldn’t change that’s been and gone…she didn’t even know if she could change what was going to come.

Hold up. Hold on.

Don’t be scared. You’ll never change what’s been and gone.

May your smile; (May your smile,)

Shine on; (Shine on.)

Don’t be scared. (Don’t be scared.)

Your destiny will keep you on,

‘Cause all of the stars, have faded away.

Just try not to worry, You’ll see them some day.

Take what you need, and be on your way and stop,

Crying your heart out.

Get up. (Get up.) Come on. (Come on.)

Why you scared? (I’m not scared.)

You’ll never change what’s been and gone.

‘Cause all of the stars, have faded away,

Just try not to worry. You’ll see them some day.

Take what you need, and be on your way and stop,

Crying your heart out.

‘Cause all of the stars, have faded away.

Just try not to worry, You’ll see them some day.

Just take what you need, and be on your way and stop,

Crying your heart out.

We’re all of the stars, We’re fading away.

Just try not to worry, You’ll see us some day.

Just take what you need, and be on your way and stop,

Crying your heart out.

Stop crying your heart out. Stop crying your heart out. Stop crying your heart out…

**A/N: And chapter three is finished! I have yet to bring in my friend’s character, goodness she is going to kill me XD! Well…I hope you enjoyed this chapter and the wonderful song from one of my favorite bands, Oasis, I think the way I wrote it kinda went with the song. I wasn’t even really listening to my music while I was writing this. I originally had it to go with Kevin Max’s song Existence, but then I decided it didn’t go well enough. Now I have horrid grammatical errors I know…If anyone would like to offer Beta skills…E-mail or IM me on MSN or AIM at: E-mail:** Airie. MSN: Airie. AIM: QueenNicura. Thanks so much! Please review constructively.
