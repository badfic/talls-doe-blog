“How Do You Get That Lonely”

Hannah took off down the road. The sounds of her feet clanking against the pavement and her heartbeat were all she could hear. Baboom, thunk-thunk, baboom, thunk-thunk. The rhythm drove her further, getting her farther and farther away from Snape’s house.

“Well, where do we go now…” she thought, coming to an intersection. “I have nowhere left…” her thoughts echoed in her mind, making the phrase permanent, irreversible… unchangeable.

Her exhaustion caught up with her, making her pant heavily. She walked to the side of the road, but she only got to the gutter before sinking to her knees, unable to go any further. She looked back… she couldn’t even see Severus’s house anymore. “How far did I go?” she thought.

Hannah pulled herself up to sit on the curb, staring at the houses down the road, lit and warm, with people that loved each other inside them. Wasn’t anyone trying to find her?

No. No one was. They could care less about Hannah Pettigrew, traitor to everyone that tried to show her any affection. She folded her arms and leaned over to rest them on her knees. A slow drizzle started, adding even more discomfort to her worn-out body.

She focused all her energy on her ears… would someone call her name? Someone had to be looking for her. There had to be someone…she heard nothing. Hannah sighed. “It’s a damned cold night,” she thought miserably.

Hannah would settle for anyone at this point. Just someone look out their window, someone drive by, someone… someone help her. She rubbed the arm with the Mark, and stared at it. “Would I be better off dead?”

It would certainly solve a lot of problems… No one would have to worry about her anymore. Not that anyone did anyway…

I’m standing on a bridge

I’m waiting in the dark

I thought that you’d be here by now

There’s nothing but the rain

No footsteps on the ground

I’m listening but there’s no sound

Isn’t anyone trying to find me?

Won’t somebody come take me home?

It’s a damn cold night

Trying to figure out this life

Wont you take me by the hand

Take me somewhere new

I don’t know who you are

But I… I’m with you

I’m with you

I’m looking for a place

Searching for a face

Is anybody here I know?

‘Cause nothing’s going right

And everything’s a mess

And no one likes to be alone

Isn’t anyone trying to find me?

Won’t somebody come take me home?

It’s a damn cold night

Trying to figure out this life

Wont you take me by the hand

Take me somewhere new

I don’t know who you are

But I… I’m with you

I’m with you

Oh why is everything so confusing

Maybe I’m just out of my mind

Yea yea yea

It’s a damn cold night

Trying to figure out this life

Won’t you take me by the hand?

Take me somewhere new

I don’t know who you are

But I… I’m with you

I’m with you

Take me by the hand

Take me somewhere new

I don’t know who you are

But I… I’m with you

I’m with you

Take me by the hand

Take me somewhere new

I don’t know who you are

But I… I’m with you

I’m with you

I’m with you…

How do you get that lonely, how do you hurt that bad

To make you make the call, that having’ no life at all

Is better than the life that you had

How do you feel so empty, you want to let it all go

How do you get that lonely… and nobody know

**A/N: Okay …Just so everyone doesn’t kill me. I didn’t write this! My dear friend Livi did! Anyway next person is going to be Axel, then back to Livi XD I wont be around much. Well enjoy this chapter. I’ll be doing 10.**
