She was waiting there in her way. The same way she always waited for him to come by. For Peeta to come by. She knew today was the day and this was their moment. The moment she had been waiting for. She was so lonely and wanted everything Peeta had to offer.

His warmth, his strong embrace. The one which had protected her all those nights in the cave and all those nights in her cabin when the nightmares came. Peeta was so warm and inviting, much like the bread he made in his oven.

He walks by, blue eyes meeting hers and he smiles that smile he saves only for her and then he jumps on her in the middle of the street and…some stuff happens and………….

This is so OBVIOUSLY how SOMEONE I know would write a sexy story. Let’s see if I can do any better :).
