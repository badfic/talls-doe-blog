I swear. I am so super-lame for writing this. I just couldn’t not write it. I need to stop watching JONAS. I’m gonna just go ahead and blame thiscoffeeshop (even though it was totally inspired by Irrevocablyamanduh-ily!) for this one too. You hear me, girl? I blame *you.*

V-Neck

Drabble.

. . . . . . . . .

Stella Malone couldn’t take her eyes off of his neck. The way the v-neck dipped to show his collar bone and a little bit of his chest was intoxicating.

“Stella?” Joe asked, noticing that she had zoned out and was staring directly at-he looked down-his…chest? His face distorted in confusion. Was this what girls felt like then he stared at their chests? Awkward? Annoyed? A little turned on?

Stella was still staring, tracing the dip in his shirt with her eyes.

“Stella!” Joe said, waving his hand in front of her face, “Earth to Stella Malone.” Stella snapped out of it and, reluctantly, pulled her eyes from his throat to look at his face.

“Yeah?” She asked.

“You were zoning out,” he said, adding in his head, *and staring at me me like you wanted to jump me. Not that I’d mind…* Joe smirked at that thought.

“Was I?” Stella asked, laughing nervously, trying to look anywhere but the place where his v-neck dipped down. Joe noticed this.

“Yes,” he responded, scooting closer to her and leaning over in a provocative manner before asking, “Do you like what you see?” Stella’s face flushed as her eyes went to his chest again. She wasn’t sure how to answer his question. Did she tell him the truth? Or did she deny it. She didn’t think she had the strength to deny it anymore.

“I…I…” She stuttered, blushing, “I certainly hope that question was rhetorical, Joseph.” She mentally kicked herself. Honestly, was that the best she could come up with?

“Honestly, *Estella*,” Joe said, “Is that the *best* you can come up with?” Stella watched his lips as he spoke, shocked at his question.

“What’re you talking about, Joe?” Stella asked, willing all the things she was feeling to go away. Joe moved closer to her. He was on his knees know, hands on either side of her lap, palms against the floor. His face was *dangerously* close to hers, his brown eyes flickering with amusement as her face flushed and her breathing hitched. He tilted his head slightly.

“This,” he said in a whisper, capturing her lips with his. Every sarcastic remark she could think of melted away in that kiss. He pressed himself into her farther, not stopping until she was flat on the floor beneath him, her fingers tracing against his collar bone gently. He kissed her roughly, pressing his tongue against her lips, pleading for entrance. She felt like the was going to stop breathing as she parted her lips.

Stella traced the v in Joe’s collar, sending sparks of electricity through his body.

“I love this shirt on you,” she said, a bit breathless, once he had pulled away. He smirked down at her.

“Isn’t that why you designed it?” He asked. Stella smirked back.

“You’ll never know.” Joe snorted and kissed her again.

I am so lame. And the “Do you like what you see?” line is totally and completely, shamelessly inspired by Suburbs. I had to incorporate it into a fanfic at some point. I wanted to see if I could push it to the point where Stella took Joe’s shirt off, but…I don’t see them ever going that far.
