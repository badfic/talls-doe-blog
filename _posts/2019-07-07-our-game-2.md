It’s like this:  
you wait a lifetime to hear hello  
but all they wanna say is good-bye  
you wait forever to be their reason  
but all they wanna tell you is a lie.

It’s like you smile for something you’re gonna lose  
waiting for that person to notice you’re not playing  
you want something serious, but they’re not into it.

So they leave you there and you don’t know what to say  
they break your heart and you wait, just wait.

There’s really nothing left now  
so you shrug your shoulders and try to get over it  
but this is the time when you realize it’s different.

The feeling isn’t the same  
this isn’t how you play the game.

You’ve never felt this way  
but you blow it off as just another stupid excuse  
you’ve said things like this before  
to those friends who are forced to listen.

Then you realize, it’s really different  
and now you’re too afraid to say the things you’re feeling  
because this isn’t what this is supposed to turn into.

It’s supposed to be a game.
