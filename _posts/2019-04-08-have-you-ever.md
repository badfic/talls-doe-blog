Have you ever been so in love  
that his smile is your lullaby,  
his eyes are your night sky,  
he overtakes your dreams.

Have you ever been so in love  
that he steals your breath  
his hair comes in whispers  
sweet caresses on your cheek.

Have you ever been so in love  
that his laugh is your morning song  
sweet melody carried by the wind  
hitting your ear in sweet rhythmic tones.

Have you ever been so in love  
that heâ€™s the soundtrack of your summer  
every song you hear makes you think of him  
in everything you write, he has a place.

Have you ever been so in love  
that you get butterflies when you see him  
even if you just catch a glimpse  
see him for a fleeting moment.
