You gave me an ultimatum. I did what you wanted. Quit my job, changed to a different one. I did absolutely everything you asked. Then last night when we were laying in bed, you were holding me, kissing my forehead, caressing my cheek gently…telling me how beautiful I am.

I whispered so softly you almost didn’t hear it

> “I love you”
> 
> and you laughed

> “That’s cute.”
