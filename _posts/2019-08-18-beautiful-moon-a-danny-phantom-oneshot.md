The moon shone brightly over Amity Park as a pair of teenagers made their way across the street. Their breathing was labored as if they had been running for awhile. Their hands were clasped together as they fled into the trees of the park in the town square. It was a full moon.

There was a clearing surrounding a rock and a small pond towards the west side of the park. The two teenagers entered it, stopping. The male bent down and held his knees, trying to catch his breath. The female would have laughed if she hadn’t been so tired herself.

“Why are we here?” The female asked, kicking off her bat slippers while walking over to the large boulder and sitting on it. Surprisingly the boulder was so close to the water she could dip her feet in it.

“Full moon,” the male said lamely.

“Is that all?” The girl asked, her feet making splashing sounds in the water. The boy watched her, his eyes traveling from her feet and up her legs only stopping where her very short purple night gown covered from her thighs up.

“No, there’s more.” The girl looked at him quizzically.

“What more?” She asked, her eyes taking him in. She noticed that he was dressed in his normal clothing consisting of blue jeans and a white shirt with a red oval on it.

She began to wonder why he had taken the time to get dressed while he didn’t even give her the time to get her robe on. Then she realized, he must sleep in his boxers. A light blush came to her cheeks and she giggled slightly earning her a look from the boy.

Sure she had seen him with his pants down tons of times. She was his best friend and he did go through that whole ‘ghost powers making it hard to keep his pants up’ thing. So she guessed almost everyone had seen his boxers, but this time it was different. She didn’t understand why.

“Well,” the boy said, tapping his lip, “there was something I wanted to tell you.” The girl’s blush got deeper as if she knew what his confession was, but she still played dumb.

“Why isn’t Tucker here too? Don’t you want him to know?” The boy blushed and kicked the ground with his foot.

“This is something I wanted just you to know.” She stared at him expectantly, but nothing came. She guessed he have frozen up.

“Danny?” She asked. Danny looked up at her and smiled slightly. She could see tears forming in his eyes and she got off the rock, rushing to him, “What is it?”

“Nothing, I’m sorry Sammy,” he said sweetly. A blushed formed on her cheeks again. Sammy? Now that was cute. He blushed this time too, reaching his hand out to cup her face. Her heart beat accelerated and he pulled her against him.

When did Danny get so good at this?

Before she could bonder her question more, their lips met and it sent her spinning. She had kissed Danny before, but those were fake-out make-outs although they did seem real to them sometimes, but this was more real than ever. He was actually kissing her!

She wrapped her arms around his neck and ran her fingers through his hair.

Then just as soon as it had begun it was all over. He pulled back from her and pressed his forehead against hers.

“I think I’m in love with you Sammy,” Danny said. Sam’s heart almost gave out at those words. She had actually heard him say it. All those years of coming second to Paulina were finally over, she was Danny’s one and only.

She brought her lips up to his, kissing him just as he had kissed her.

“I think I love you too,” She whispered against his lips, not willing to pull back.

No one is to know if love truly exists, but tonight it did as they held each other tightly the beautiful moon reflected in the water next to them.
