**Secret Oblivion**

**-Chapter Five-**

**Disclaimer: I own not Harry Potter, but own I do the OC: Hannah Pettigrew. My friend owns the OC that will come along later. (OC used with permission)**

**Summary: When Hannah becomes a death eater she peers into her future to see what will become of her life. When she sees Sirius become hurt, she vows to never let that happen, but will she remember the images in time to save everyone? SB/OC SS/OC JP/LP**

**A/N: Well guys…this is the fifth chapter. I hope you all enjoy.**

“Missing”

Hannah sobbed into his chest for hours, and he stood there and let her. He was unsure of what to do, but when the sun started going down he had to push her away.

“Hannah…” Snape said calmly. She dried her eyes and looked up at him. Snape frowned. Hannah looked pitiful, it was enough to make him cry. “Um…listen…why don’t we get something to eat?” Snape asked, trying to cheer her up.

“I don’t feel very hungry right now,” she said sniffling. Snape put his arm around her shoulders and led her down the road. Hannah tried to stop, but Snape kept her on.

“Eating will do you good, Hannah,” He whispered, She hiccuped and cried more. Snape sighed deeply. He knew Sirius was mean but…did he really have to knock her down?

**– 0 –**

Sirius watched them walk away and he sighed. He couldn’t help but think of how jealous he was. Hannah with Snape? This was unreal! How could that…loser have her when he couldn’t?

Of course, he had left her when she needed him most. He shook his head miserably and walked the other direction. He shouldn’t dwell on her. She was a Death eater after all.

Even with his back turned her could tell she was leaning on him and he was comforting her. He couldn’t take it his temper was rising. This was torture for him to see the woman he loved with another man. If only he had voiced his feelings sooner! If only he would’ve stayed to talk to her about why and how she had become a Death eater. This hardly seemed fair. Even if he had turned his back on her…she had no right to go after another man! And what was with that panther?

Snape led Hannah into a small restaurant on the corner and brought her to a table. The waitress handed them both menus and Hannah lay her head down on the table. Snape had to admit she looked like a total wreck. Her hair was stuck to her face and her eyes were red and puffy. But he guessed that was nothing compared to the pain she felt inside right now.

He had always thought Hannah to be strong emotionally and physically, but seeing her like this has proofed him wrong. She was crying over a worthless guy, but maybe her pain was more than that. Snape hadn’t been around her long enough to tell really. He looked over her. She was wearing a white long sleeved turtleneck sweater with a black stripe in the center and a black skirt, muggle clothing. He noticed a small blood stain on the arm of her shirt. He touched it gingerly and she allowed him to push up the sleeve and examine the mark on her forearm.

When he gasped and pulled down the sleeve quickly Hannah looked up, expecting him to leave. He didn’t so she stared at him. He made a weird motion to his arm and pointed to hers and she knew what he meant. Snape was marked too. She was kind of glad. She had been so scared because all of her friends were abandoning her over a mark. She smiled at Snape and gave a nod, showing she understood and the waitress came to take their order.

After they ate they sat there talking for awhile until the restaurant started to close. Hannah and Snape left, glancing around the outside before realizing there was barely anyone outside.

“Well, looks like we’ve missed curfew,” Snape joked. Hannah looked horrified.

“Oh no Severus, what will we do?” Snape laughed and took her hand. All three of them took off down the sidewalk until they arrived in a small neighborhood right outside the city. They slowed and walked up to a house. Snape took out his wand and unlocked the door. Hannah, Snape, and the panther stepped inside. Hannah looked around and then back at Snape.

“Is this where you live?” She asked, Snape nodded and laughed.

“What you expected me to live with my mother?” Hannah laughed.

“Well…” She started, “You were voted most likely to live with your mother…” Snape looked confused.

“I was?” Hannah smirked and he got it. “You little liar,” He said advancing on her. Hannah stood her around as the tickle fight started. She screamed and kicked.

“Stop! Stop!” She screamed between giggles. Snape kept on and both fell onto the ground.

“What’s that Hannah?” He asked, still tickling. Hannah tried to speak, but she was in tears and was out of breath from laughing so hard.

Soon enough he stopped and the two lay on the ground, breathing hard. Hannah was still giggling in-between her sharp gasps for air. Snape rolled onto his side and stared at her. He noticed her hair was spread around everywhere. He never really realized how long it was until now. It was very long and silky. He has the sudden urge to touch it.

“So…” Snape said trying to start a conversation. Hannah looked at him expectantly. “Why did you take the mark Hannah?” He asked, fulfilling his urge. He twirled her black hair around his fingers, and Hannah sighed. She wasn’t sure what to tell him. She couldn’t say she was tricked…she didn’t think he would believe that! She shook her head and shrugged.

“I’m not sure really…I guess…” She started, but stopped and shook her head.

“You guess what?” He asked, still playing with her hair. It was so soft against his fingers.

“I was tricked into it,” she whispered. Snape stared at her, not sure what to say.

“How?” He asked. He was intrigued by her answer.

“It’s a long story actually…” She said with a deep sigh.

“I’m willing to listen,” he said. Hannah stared at him, tears forming in her already puffy eyes. She was happy someone would her out. She was happy someone cared.

Please, please forgive me,

But I won’t be home again.

Maybe someday you’ll look out,

And, barely conscious, you’ll say to no one:

Isn’t something missing?

You won’t cry for my absence, I know

You forgot me long ago.

Am I that unimportant?

Am I so insignificant?

Isn’t something missing?

Isn’t someone missing me?

Even though I’d be sacrificed,

You won’t try for me, not now.

Though I’d die to know you love me,

I’m all alone.

Isn’t someone missing me?

Please, please forgive me,

But I won’t be home again.

I know what you do to yourself,

I breathe deep and cry out:

Isn’t something missing?

Isn’t someone missing me?

Even though I’d be sacrificed,

You won’t try for me, not now.

Though I’d die to know you love me,

I’m all alone.

Isn’t someone missing me?

And if I bleed, I’ll bleed,

Knowing you don’t care.

And if I sleep just to dream of you

And wake without you there,

Isn’t something missing?

Isn’t something…

Even though I’d be sacrificed,

You won’t try for me, not now.

Though I’d die to know you love me,

I’m all alone.

Isn’t something missing?

Isn’t someone missing me?
