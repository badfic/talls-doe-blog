It has come to my attention recently, after a few of my close friends yelled at me, that people don’t know I’ve written books.

So I’m here to set the record straight. My name is Desdemona Wren and I have written 4 books; 2 novels &amp; 2 novellas and I’m going to tell you a little bit about them.

First up, The Marjorie Diaz series: [Marjorie Diaz’s Unfortunate Introduction to Magical High Society](https://amzn.to/2UooF6g) and [Marjorie Diaz’s Unfortunate Introduction to Ancestral Politics &amp; Foul Play](https://amzn.to/2WVeNOp).

The Marjorie Diaz series follows Marjorie Diaz, a 22 year-old Mexican American college student who manages to piss off some magical high royals and gets herself marked for death.

And while that seems like a very bad thing (TM), the story keeps cutting deeper and Marjorie discovers everyone has a secret, including her best friend.

This title is LGBT with acespec rep, lesbian rep, bisexual/pansexual rep, and transgender characters. There is also POC rep with Mexican American, Black American, Zimbabwean, and British Indian characters.

Next up, [Bloom: A Monster Love Novella](https://amzn.to/2D2cQYN) and [Call Me Eli](https://amzn.to/2YW74RZ) (my anthology piece).

Both of these books feature transgender characters in same-sex relationships.

[Bloom: A Monster Love Novella](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B4SLH9S/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=myblog7709-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07B4SLH9S&linkId=901dce1d75c4ce5b6f70416a496e6c08) is about Holly Juniper who falls for a nymph who comes through a portal in her barn. She gets more than she bargained for, when Nia helps her discover what she was truly meant to do.

[Call Me Eli](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JYW83WY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=myblog7709-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07JYW83WY&linkId=bb7a06fa2250b8218ba3dd5e1ba84a32) is about a transman who falls in love with a rock star when he shows up and hijacks Eli’s cab ride back from his impromptu concert at CosFest, a huge con he goes to with his best friend every year. It’s a Cinderella story, but with a fresh take. They’re adorable together and I’ll be rewriting their story when I get the rights back in August.

I have another few books I want to release this year: Nighthawks: A Monster Love Novella, A City of Glass and Sand, Marjorie 3, A Reverse Harem story, and The Incredible Origins of Suzie Q, Demon Hunter Extraordinaire.
