I thought I should update this because like, I just now realized it doesn’t have as many chapters as I thought it did. I’m probably going to be skipping ahead a bit in this chapter. That Cinderella Ball is making me want to. Gaaah. I can’t wait to get there!

Even Better

Chapter Three

. . . . . . . .

There was only a week left until the Cinderella Ball and Nick was not looking forward to it. He tried on multiple occasions to get out of going, but Stella practically had a cow.

“You *have* to come, Nick,” Stella said. It was the thousandth time he had begged her not to force him to come. “You and your brothers are providing the entertainment for the evening.” Nick grimaced. He had almost forgotten that he had to perform. Well, this sucked.

“I don’t have a date,” Nick told her, “I don’t want to go alone.” Stella snorted.

“Nick,” She told him, walking over to the window in his room and opening it. The sound of screaming girls pierced his ears. He winced at the sound and gave Stella a “what are you getting at?” look. Stella motioned out the window. “You’ve got a whole sea of fangirls out there, Nick,” she told him, “Just pick one.” Nick stared at Stella and sighed.

*That’s not the fangirl I want,*He thought bitterly, turning away from his older brother’s best friend with a hurt expression on his face and headed towards one of the three fireman poles.

“Nick?” Stella asked, confused by his reaction, “Did I say something to upset you?” Nick stopped, his back still to her as he put his hand on the railing around the poles. He gathered all of his courage and turned to look at her again.

“No,” Nick said, a slight smile, “thanks for the advice, but I don’t want to cause a riot amongst those girls. Besides, I really like this outfit.” Stella laughed. It had been so long since the boys had been attacked by their fangirls that she had almost forgotten what little clothes-shredding terrors they really were.

“Are you going stag?” She asked before adding, “because I don’t have a date. I could go with you. It’ll be like a friend thing.” Nick smirked and stared down at his sneakers.

“Thanks for the offer, Stells,” He said, “But I have someone else in mind.”

“Who?” Stella asked, eyebrows raised. Nick wracked his brain for a name, any name. He didn’t want Stella to think that he was lying to her, even though he was. He just didn’t want to have to go with Stella. He *couldn’t* go with Stella. Any other time he would’ve accepted her offer, but now that he knew how bad it hurt to see one of your brothers with the girl you had fallen for…He couldn’t do that to Joe.

“Penny,” he blurted, automatically feeling stupid for saying it.

“Penny?” Stella asked, “didn’t she dump you and break your heart into a million pieces?” Nick winced. Way to put it lightly, Stella. “Besides,” she continued, “I heard that she’s going with Ricky.” Nick ground his teeth together. Did Stella always have to be so in tune with gossip?

“Oh,” He responded, feeling slightly embarrassed, “I’m sure I’ll figure something out then…”

“I just tol-” She stared, but he cut her off.

“Bye, Stella,” He said, running around the railing and sliding down the closest pole. Even if Stella was just trying to be nice and help him out, he couldn’t do that to Joe. Besides, he had a hunch Joe was going to ask her to go to the Cinderella thing soon anyway.

“Hey, Nick…” Joe said from where he was at the kitchen table, hunched over a couple cartons of milk. Okay, so maybe he had a little more than a hunch. Joe only drank copious amounts of milk when he was upset about something. Nick walked to the table and pulled out a chair.

“What is it, Joe?” Nick asked, taking a seat at the table.

“There’s this girl I like…” Joe said, trailing off. Nick knew where this was going.

“If you want to ask Stella to the Cinderella Ball then do it,” Nick said before Joe could continue. Joe stared at his brother in shock.

“Pfft.” Joe said, nervousness washing over his features, “I don’t want to ask *Stella*. What makes you think I’d want to go to…Stella, *really*?” Joe was a bad liar. Nick just shook his head and got up from the table, heading for the front door.

“Where are you going?” Joe called after him. Somewhere, nowhere, everywhere. Nick didn’t answer him. Instead, he opened the door and walked out into the cold winter air. He shoved his hands in his pockets to protect them from the cold. He just needed to get away for a little while. Maybe walking outside in the cold would help in take his mind off of Macy. Or at least give Joe the chance to ask Stella to the Cinderella Ball. That way he wouldn’t feel bad for declining her offer to go as friends.

“Hey, Nick!” He heard someone call out to him. He turned around, seeing Macy running to catch up with him.

“Macy?” Nick asked, checking his surroundings to make sure he was where he thought he was, “What’re you doing out here?”

“Kevin invited me over,” she said, a bit breathless.

“Oh…” He said, “why?”

“Operation get Joe to ask Stella,” she responded simply, “You want to help us?” Nick chuckled.

“No,” he said, he didn’t think he could stand seeing Macy and Kevin together anymore than he had to, “you two go ahead, I was just about to go for a walk.” Macy arched an eyebrow at him.

“It’s *freezing* out here, Nick,” Macy said, “Are you *insane*?” Nick stared at her in shock for a moment.

“Uh,” he said, “the cold doesn’t really bother me, but thanks for the concern…” he trailed off, staring down at the ground awkwardly.

“Come on, Nick,” Macy said, “Don’t you want to see me and Kevin shove Stella and Joe into a closet or something? It’ll be fun.” Her persuading was making it harder for him to continue with his earlier plan to go on a walk to clear his head.

“That would be a funny thing to watch…” Nick admitted, still staring at his shoes. Macy leaned forward, bending slightly so her face was in his field of vision. He took a step back.

“So you’ll help us?” She asked, a big smile on her face. Nick swore he felt his heart skip a beat. He loved that smile.

“Okay,” Nick said. Macy clapped her hands together and jumped once to show her excitement. Nick swallowed hard when she reached down and took his hand, leading him back towards the firehouse. “This is going to be *awesome*.”

Nick wondered what he had just gotten himself into.

. . . . . . . . .

My iTunes is psychic. Right when I typed “*That’s not the fangirl I want,* He thought bitterly” the song Can’t Have You by the Jonas Brothers started playing. Pretty freaky if you ask me. I apologize for the OOC. And yay, Joella chapter! I had to put this in as a filler.

Even Better

Chapter Four

BEGIN &amp;&amp;

Helping Kevin and Macy get Stella and Joe to admit their feelings would be *even better* if he didn’t have to watch Kevin and Macy look at each other all googly-eyed in the process.

He didn’t even think their plan was working, but they weren’t doing much planning as it was anyway. They just kept glancing at each other shyly and blushing and looking away. Nick didn’t know whether he wanted to scream or vomit. He supposed he wanted to do both.

“So,” Nick said after they had looked at each other and blushed for the *millionth* time that evening, “How’re we doing this?” The two looked at him, shrugging their shoulders. This was not going the way he had hoped. He hoped that this would help get her off of his mind. But he supposed that working *with* her might’ve been poor judgment on his part.

He bit his lip, glaring at the floor. This must’ve been what they needed him for; they wanted him to be the one to come up with a plan. He could see where they were coming from. Because, let’s face it, Kevin wasn’t the best person to go to for coming up with plans. Nick sighed and stood up, marching into the kitchen and staring down at his older brother. Did he have to do *everything* around here?

“Joe,” Nick said, noticing that there were more milk cartons littered all over the table, and Joe’s head was resting against his arm. He groaned, turning his head slightly to the side, letting Nick know he had heard him.

“Go upstairs and ask Stella to the Cinderella ball or I swear I’m gonna do it myself.” Joe sat up quickly and glared at his younger brother.

“Not cool, man!” He yelled and Nick resisted the urge to smirk.

“I’m serious,” Nick said, “I’m going to ask Stella if you don’t. Just think of how *amazing* she’s going to look in her gown…” he trailed off. Joe looked completely freaked.

“You wouldn’t ask her to the ball,” Joe said, “You wouldn’t.” Nick crossed his arms.

“Someone else asked the girl I wanted to go with,” he said, “so…give me one good reason why I shouldn’t go with Stella.”

“Because!” Joe shouted, getting up from the table, and moving so he was in his little brother’s face. Nick held his ground, staring back at Joe, his face completely serious.

“Because isn’t an answer,” Nick responded, smirking at his older brother. Joe cried out and stomped his foot in frustration. Nick turned away from his brother and started towards the stairs that lead to their room.

“I’m gonna go ask her right now,” Nick said, “I’m sure she’ll say yes. Seeing as how *no one else* wants to ask her.” He heard Joe huff behind him, but he made no motion to move from his spot. “Besides, earlier she asked *me* if I wanted to go with her. You know since *no one else* had asked her.” Nick continued towards the stairs, hoping his brother would bite soon.

“Whatever, man!” He said, pushing past his younger brother and heading up the stairs. Nick just chuckled lightly. Who knew bringing competition into this would make Joe finally ask Stella out? Oh right. He did.

He turned around, brushing his shoulders off and heading back into the living room where Kevin and Macy were beaming at him.

“That was *perfect*, Nick,” Macy said, bounding up to him and throwing her arms around his neck. Nick laughed nervously, hugging her back as she jumped up and down against him. He looked over at his oldest brother, trying to get his mind off of the cute brunette that was jumping up and down happily.

“High five, dude,” Kevin said, holding up his hand. Nick smiled, slapping his brother’s hand. Macy stayed against him for a few seconds longer before she pulled away and pulled her cell phone, which had just vibrated, out of her pocket.

“It’s a text from, Stella!” Macy shrieked. Kevin and Nick leaned in, reading over her shoulder as she opened it.

Omg, Macy. Joe just asked me to the Cinderella Ball. I can’t wait to get started on our dresses! We’re going to look *amazing*!. –Stella.

Macy squealed, hugging Nick again. Nick bit his lip and sighed as he hugged her back. His heart was racing and he found himself wondering why Macy thought it was a good idea to hug him.

Sure, he was the one who had made it possible that Joe and Stella had *finally*(sort of) gotten together, but that didn’t mean she needed to—he swallowed—press her warm body against his and…rest her head on his shoulder. Her scent assaulted his nostrils and he took a shaky breath.

“This is going to be *so* awesome,” she said. He could feel her breath against his neck and he almost whimpered. Goosebumps had appeared on his skin. He held his breath.

“Yeah,” Nick said, closing his eyes for a moment to try and clear this whole scene out of his head. He needed to escape from what was going on. And he needed to do it without hurting Macy by shoving her away. But even when he closed his eyes he could still feel her body against his. He could still feel her breathing against his neck.

“Group hug,” he heard his oldest brother announce from behind him, wrapping his arms around both him and Macy. Nick sighed.

Didn’t he know he was making his a lot harder than it should’ve been? Didn’t *they* know that the girl he had wanted to take (that got asked by someone else) was the girl that was hugging him right now?

No, he guessed they didn’t know. He really should learn to voice his feelings better.

END &amp;&amp;

It seems a little rushed or whatever. I’m kinda swamped in stories right now. So many ideas keep happening! Haaa. I should stop txting! Just kidding. I love the girls I text. Cayce, Laxmi, Mandy…I love you girls =).
