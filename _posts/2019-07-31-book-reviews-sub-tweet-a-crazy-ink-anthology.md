With a title like [Sub Tweet](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HY8F96P/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=myblog7709-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07HY8F96P&linkId=080e15fe099f170bb536c68a139b82b1) I was excited to see what this was going to be about. Everyone knows I’m the master of subtweeting people (not really, I lack a whole bunch of subtlety, lbr).

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.desdemonawren.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/pw2.gif?resize=500%2C281&ssl=1)</figure></div>I was blown away by the sheer talents of the authors in [this anthology](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HY8F96P/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=myblog7709-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07HY8F96P&linkId=080e15fe099f170bb536c68a139b82b1). I absolutely adored every second of [this book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HY8F96P/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=myblog7709-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07HY8F96P&linkId=080e15fe099f170bb536c68a139b82b1). I ended up reading it in just a single day, and while I did skip one or two stories (because of triggering subject matter – sexual assault, kidnapping) I’m happy I read it.

It was more than just an [anthology](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HY8F96P/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=myblog7709-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07HY8F96P&linkId=080e15fe099f170bb536c68a139b82b1) about subtweets, it was a whole commentary on technology and how we as humans have come to rely on it so much. The authors used subtweets or vague books to start off their [stories](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HY8F96P/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=myblog7709-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07HY8F96P&linkId=080e15fe099f170bb536c68a139b82b1) and launched into an entire world of what said tweet or Facebook post could mean.

There are people you’re hurting with these things you say, but the person you’re hurting the most is yourself. This [anthology](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HY8F96P/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=myblog7709-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07HY8F96P&linkId=080e15fe099f170bb536c68a139b82b1) does a good job of making sure people know that it is entirely unfair to say these types of things because all it’s going to do is come back on you.

Some of these stories were total knock outs. I adored them. Crazy Ink really knows how to put together a good [anthology](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HY8F96P/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=myblog7709-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07HY8F96P&linkId=080e15fe099f170bb536c68a139b82b1)!
