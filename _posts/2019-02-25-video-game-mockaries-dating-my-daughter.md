## NSFW Warning

And as always, with <font color="#007fac">13 </font>as my captive audience, over 2000 miles away, we discovered something rather troubling. It was a game, of sorts, more like a dating sim. Where you date uh…your \*ahem\* …biological daughter whom you haven’t seen in several years following your divorce from her mother.

Wonder why you got divorced dude.

After much deliberation wherein Thirteen and I discuss my very sanity and the depth of my self-hatred, my curiosity got the better of me and I downloaded the game.

And so it begins, with a loading screen.

**Thirteen:** Well. At least it’s honest about the terrible, terrible thing it is from the beginning.   
**Santiago:** (my partner, off in the wings) Why is there a butt?  
**Me:** Don’t ask. You *really, really* don’t want to know.

**Thirteen:** I feel like it needs to be something appropriately horrid yet hilarious to fit out avat–Humbert?   
**Me:** Yes.   
**Thirteen:** Amazing. And terrifying.

**Thirteen:**  Welp I mean the obvious answer is Lolita to match.  
**Me:** Of course, but Delores or Lolita?  
**Thirteen:** Lolita. Dolores is a touch more subtle but I don’t see a reason to waste subtlety on this shit.

**Thirteen:** Spoiler Alert: it was to avoid you, you disgusting subhuman filth!   
**Me:** Also there’s no sound so this is fucking eerie as fuck.   
**Thirteen:**  Ew.   
**Thirteen:** Well.It was going to be super creepy anyway.  
**Me:**  at least I can play it without headphones.

**Thirteen:**  I would say “only because we know where this is going” but no   
**Thirteen:**  They pretty much are regardless.  
**Thirteen:**  And you know. I just KNOW every time people make sure to point out a character is 18 that that means they actually aren’t.   
**Thirteen:** So. Yeah. :I

**Thirteen:**  o\_\_\_o   
**Thirteen:**  This is really bad coming off Dream Daddy because I’m trying to squish down residual “awww” feelings because I know this is going to be terrible.   
**Me:**  I keep thinking about Dream Daddy too. It can’t save us now.   
**Thirteen:** On one hand I need Golden Child and her totally-sweet-and-non-creepy dad to make things better, on the other I want them FOREVER AWAY FROM THIS.

**Me:** He’s only getting ready to entertain his daughter.   
**Thirteen:** There’s totally at least two dicks in there.  
**Thirteen:** Oh well of course  
**Thirteen:** Why didn’t I think of that
