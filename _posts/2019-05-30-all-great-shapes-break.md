You might not ever see this  
And you might not even care  
but I want to let you know–  
you still mean the world to me  
your voice still echoes in my head  
the place in my back still tingles  
when I think about kissing you.

You might not ever see this  
but maybe you’ll still care  
that you still make my sun rise  
you give my world all it’s color  
and you always open my eyes  
to different possibilities.

Maybe you’ll see this  
and I know that you’ll still care  
that I hear your voice in all my memories  
that every memory I have of you plays so s l o w l y  
that I swear it comes to life and all I can focus on is…  
your breathing, the taste of your lips  
and even with my eyes closed  
I can still see you, clear as day.

But…  
Maybe you **wont** see this  
and maybe you’ll just break  
let the stars and all great shapes  
fall between our hearts  
<sup>maybe in your world, we’re better off apart.</sup>
