I had a friend once who told me

> *“You’re a joke, your art sucks, your emotive writing makes me laugh. Every single bad thing that happens to you…you deserve. I’ve been a good friend for you for so long and…”*

and it hurt, but I guess I deserved it because I wasn’t afraid to call her out  
on the things she would’ve rather not been aired on her personal page  
about how  
she really isn’t a good person  
or a good friend  
because all she really is…  
is this cheap, bitter, unreliable, irritating person  
who has no place in my life  
and her friendship is literally laughable  
because she’s the same person, who told me

> *“There’s no such thing as bisexual. You can’t be bisexual because it doesn’t exist. You can’t be attracted to both men and women. You’re dating a man, you’re straight.”*

and the worst thing is, she’s homosexual  
it made me feel like  
no one would ever accept me  
because I couldn’t help being attracted to both sexes  
I thought there was something wrong with me…

**I still do**
