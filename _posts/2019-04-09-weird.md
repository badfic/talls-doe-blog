“You’ll never make me feel the way he does.”  
“You chose me first.”  
“I didn’t choose you.”  
“You wanted me first.”  
“I didn’t want you.”  
“You’re lying.”  
“I was interested. I didn’t want you. I didn’t choose you.”  
“You were interested in me first.”  
“I didn’t know him then.”  
“You would’ve still liked me.”  
“I wish I didn’t.”  
“No, you don’t.”  
“Yes, I do.”  
“Why?”  
“You’re ruining my relationship.”  
“That isn’t my fault.”  
“You want it to be.”  
“Maybe.”  
“That’s cruel.”  
“You’re cruel.”  
“You can’t honestly think that.”  
“I do.”  
“I see the way you look at me.”  
“You see what you want to see.”  
“Maybe I do.”  
“You can’t honestly expect me to believe that you have feelings for him.”  
“You’ll never make me feel the way he does.”  
“So you still have feelings for me?”  
“Ones that are dying.”  
“You still want me?”  
“I never wanted you.”  
“You’re still interested in me?”  
“I don’t want to be.”  
“But you are.”  
“Not like I am with him.”  
“More or less?”  
“Less.”  
“Why?”  
“You’ll never make me feel the way he does.”  
“You’ve said that three times.”  
“It’s true.”  
“Whatever.”  
“I have to go.”  
“Whatever.”  
“Bye.”  
“Later.”
