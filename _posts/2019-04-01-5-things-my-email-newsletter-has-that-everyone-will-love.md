That’s right fans of Desdemona Wren (me) and queer literature (what myself and most of my friends write) I have an [email newsletter](https://desdemonawren.com/) you can sign up for right now immediately!

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.desdemonawren.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/source-1.gif?resize=685%2C401&ssl=1)</figure></div>This means you’ll never miss out on what I’m reading. Or what book I’m writing. [My newsletter](https://desdemonawren.com/) has it all!

#### Here’s 5 things my [email newsletter](https://desdemonawren.com/) has that everyone will love:

1\. I *only* send it once a month  
2\. I promote other queer authors in my “What I’m reading section”  
3\. Sneak peaks for what I’m writing   
4\. New fanart I haven’t promo’d on my blog yet  
5\. Early access to ARCs and giveaways!

But if you’re jonesing for some more of my work and want to see all of this more than once a month, you can [support me on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/desdemonawren) where you’ll also get access to my erotic stories, cool comic pages, crack drawings of my characters, and more!
