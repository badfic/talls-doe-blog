Oh my gosh! I loved [this book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JKDY5Y4/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=myblog7709-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07JKDY5Y4&linkId=84da178a02f4ca2f5ba3ab201605e5ab). I loved every second of it.

I am obsessed with Cathal. Like he and I are pretty much the same person. And Felix! I loved him so much.

Literally, [this book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JKDY5Y4/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=myblog7709-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07JKDY5Y4&linkId=84da178a02f4ca2f5ba3ab201605e5ab) is like a breath of fresh air! There is so much LGBTQIA+ representation in here that I really felt seen. There is acespec representation, bisexual representation, gay representation, lesbian representation, and I think there were even some straight people?

The romance is a juicy, juicy slowburn that took just enough time to woo me as a reader and convince me that Damon and Cathal belonged together. I was rooting for them for the whole book because these two broken men need each other to survive.

Cathal especially since he can’t cook and spends all of his “alone time” eating instant ramen and not knowing what half of the stuff Damon cooks is. I love how clueless and adorable he was about cooking, but how smart he was about space.

At the end of [the book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JKDY5Y4/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=myblog7709-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07JKDY5Y4&linkId=84da178a02f4ca2f5ba3ab201605e5ab), I’m pretty sure even Era shipped them from beyond the grave. She had a hand in getting them together, after all. I like to imagine her ghost chatting with Felix casually about it over a box of Lucky Charms. Her two broken boys finding comfort in one another after her loss.

Great, now I’m crying again.

Seriously, though. [This book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JKDY5Y4/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=myblog7709-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07JKDY5Y4&linkId=84da178a02f4ca2f5ba3ab201605e5ab) was incredible. It was a little slow in the beginning, but once it picks up it picks up FAST and I read the bulk of it in just a few days. I cannot wait to see more from [M.A Hinkle](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JKDY5Y4/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=myblog7709-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07JKDY5Y4&linkId=84da178a02f4ca2f5ba3ab201605e5ab)!

I cannot wait for the next [book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JKDY5Y4/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=myblog7709-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07JKDY5Y4&linkId=84da178a02f4ca2f5ba3ab201605e5ab) in the series that focuses on Felix and the twins. I know it is going to be as incredible, if not moreso than this one. I love [M.A Hinkle](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JKDY5Y4/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=myblog7709-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07JKDY5Y4&linkId=84da178a02f4ca2f5ba3ab201605e5ab) and I’m willing to bet I’m going to be a life-long fan.
