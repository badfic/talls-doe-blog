She was  
 born in hartford  
 a crush among many  
 slender waist graced by tight-fit jeans  
 tan skin  
 a vision to behold  
 *a 20*.  
  
She was  
 born in a desert  
 a **one** true love  
 stretched-skin in skinny jeans  
 pale snow white  
 an emotional wreck  
 a beautiful disaster  
 *an 80*.  
  
She was  
 cold black eyes  
 harsh pink lips  
 long black hair  
 confidence  
 *an infatuation*.  
  
She was  
 sparkling brown eyes  
 pouty pale lips  
 short brown hair  
 electricity  
 *Love*  
  
He was  
 a tale of two roads  
 a choice to make  
 a struggle  
  
She is  
 an undecided everything  
 her bitter enemy  
 **His**
