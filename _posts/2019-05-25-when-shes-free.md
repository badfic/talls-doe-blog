She told a lie and now she’s stuck  
sinking and suffocating in their accusations  
their unwillingness to want to help her  
but they don’t seem to understand  
that there’s only  
**THREE HUNDRED DAYS** or  
*ten months* or  
7 , 2 0 0 hours or  
25,920,000 *seconds* until  
she can finally fly again  
and her wings aren’t broken  
by the weight of **broken promises**  
and their invalid arguments  
and their crushing laughter  
when all she can think about  
is her 300 days or 10 months or 7,200 hours or  
25,920,000 seconds until she’s finally free  
and ready to fly.
