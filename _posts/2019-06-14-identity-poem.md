> i think in lyrics  
>  they fall from my lips like rain.  
>  i think in waves of light, color, love.  
>  i am what, who, where i am.  
>  i am a rainbow, spectrum of light.  
>  i bend, the lighter side of him.  
>  perhaps, but the darker your shadow  
>  the closer you get to the light.  
>  i am vibrant  
>  making my own light because i am farther.  
>  i wish i were darker so i could be close  
>  to the warmth.  
>  alas, i am but vibrancy.

&amp; all my poetry is about you.
