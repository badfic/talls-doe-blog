You, my darling are a vice  
with your soft pink lips  
and barely-there curves  
hidden behind the most   
*perfect* shade of red.

Darling, you’re the essence  
of perfection, small hands   
with thin fingers curved   
over keys of black and ivory  
slamming out a beautiful melody.

Your laugh is like music  
and your smile is the moon  
you’re nervous across from me  
like you know what’s coming  
but don’t you, sweetheart?

It’s obvious what I want  
what I need from you,  
“just a taste”, darling  
and you’re all mine.
