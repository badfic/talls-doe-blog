With this red thread she can’t hold on anymore  
there’s this wall between them  
a wall of pain that they’ll either get over  
or break heartstrings trying.

“*you can’t reach me anymore*”  
is what she says when she falls into  
**WONDERLAND**  
through a small hole   
the size of her fist  
and strategically placed  
in her back yard.

He searches because he’s sorry  
that she’ll never be able to sleep again  
without the sound of his voice  
whispering sweet “I love you’s”  
and begging her to calm down.

She falls because she doesn’t know  
<sub>the way back up</sub>  
or that going **back** up is even and option.

She knows she’s not Alice,  
but the promise of *never hurting again*  
seemed far too good to pass up.

He’s not the **white rabbit**  
but he’s late for a *very important date*  
and he knows he’s too late to reach her.

All he remembers are her last words  
the only thing that can carry him home.
