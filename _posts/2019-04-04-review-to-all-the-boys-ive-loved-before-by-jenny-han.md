This was very different from the Netflix Film. Which isn’t a bad thing. Netflix painted everyone in a really positive light to tie up things nicely in the end whereas the book had a little more time to make things messy.

I have to say, the Laura Jean in the book is a whole lot less responsible than the Laura Jean in the movie. Something I really liked. She’s a little selfish, a lot mean to her younger sister Kitty and she really struggles with her day-to-day life.

Not when the letters get sent out. Also, Josh is a lot more confused in the book than he was in the film and Laura Jean doesn’t avoid him all the way until Christmas.

Not to mention, neither he nor Margot approve of Peter pretty much ever. And the fight between Laura Jean and Margot was a whole lot more explosive and during a huge party Laura Jean and Margot planned. It was kind of heart-wrenching, but the Song girls pull through.

Of course, I also love romance, but there is something about a positive sibling relationship that always gives me the feels. This one is no exception.

The one thing I thought the movie did a little better was it made Peter seem like a better guy. In the book he seems kind of ew. Plus, there was a video to accompany Laura Jean’s psuedo-sexual encounter and they wrap that whole mess up really quickly with Margot taking the lead and accusing Gen of being a giant twat.

Like, Laura Jean’s reputation is ruined. And Margot, instead of being on her side, believes the rumor with no evidence whatsoever. It hurt me and shook me to my core that Margot could think that of her sister. Everything works out in the end for them, of course, but that part was really touch-and-go there for awhile.

I’m looking forward to reading the rest of the books in the series!

I can’t wait to see what happens in the rest of this series. I hear Netflix is doing another movie and I would 1000% watch that.
