Enveloped in your arms  
cheek pressed to the soft flesh of your chest  
listening to your words come softly  
the words that tell me  
“this isn’t love”  
then what is it?  
What are these caresses  
declarations  
sexual encounters  
“convenience”?  
And I’m used up  
bitter and cut off from the world  
because I love you more than anything  
because I dared to love someone like you  
more than life itself  
and my reward  
is forever remembering you
