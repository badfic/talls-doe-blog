It’s sort of like paranormal romance, but it doesn’t have any vampires in it. I know everybody really likes vampires and stuff, but [nymphs](https://amazon.com/Bloom-Monster-Novella-Desdemona-Wren-ebook/dp/B07B4SLH9S/ref=la_B07B4WG4S8_1_1?) are cool too, right?

<del>Apparently not considering a straight, white male who wrote a book from a masculine viewpoint with all straight, white male characters told me my book was too “niche”. </del> I’m not bitter.

I never really thought of myself as the type of person to write short romance novellas, but I did write one. Shocking, right? With a username like wholesaleromance.

Now, in the book, the romance isn’t the main part of the plot. It happens, but the plot is more about the main character, [Holly](https://amazon.com/Bloom-Monster-Novella-Desdemona-Wren-ebook/dp/B07B4SLH9S/ref=la_B07B4WG4S8_1_1?), coming to terms with what she wants her life to be. The romance is short and a bit fast, but in the end, it helps.

Holly ultimately determines her goals. She makes new friends, she discovers new things, and she finally, *finally,* gets up the courage to go off to college.

I know this is really niche (that word again) or whatever because apparently, the only paranormal creatures people wanna read about are, like, Dragon shifters and vampires, but that’s kind of the point isn’t it? Where are my other [monster lovers](https://amazon.com/Bloom-Monster-Novella-Desdemona-Wren-ebook/dp/B07B4SLH9S/ref=la_B07B4WG4S8_1_1?) at?

I’m tired of reading about vampires. I’m tired of reading about abnormally hot pale white dudes seducing women. It’s exhausting how heteronormative the writing world is.

I get that, but you have to understand that this is the kind of representation I wanted when I was growing up.

I didn’t have a supportive family, or parents who gave a shit about me, or friends who thought being gay was “a-ok”. I grew up in the **Bible Belt**.

I was severely mistreated by most people around me. All I had were books, and I never got to read lesbian romances that weren’t 100% tragic. There were some MLM books in my school library that were less tragic than the lesbian ones, but I liked girls. I didn’t like guys all that much. I wanted to have representation for people like me. I never found it, not until I was much older.

I just want newer generations of lgbt teens to have something to look forward to.

So I write gays in magical worlds, gays as main characters, gays as normal fucking people instead of as masturbation fodder for straight people.

Just normal, every day people falling in love. That’s all I ever wanted. I hope that you guys want it too. Cause I’mma keep writing for the people who are “*niche*” and under-represented.

This INCLUDES POC characters. I despise that there isn’t enough representation of POC culture in the writing industry. Like, please stop writing boring white characters, thanks. It’s time for some friggin representation up in this bitch.

I also write books with more women than men because I’m tired of all the male main characters or the male love interests of female main characters (but the love interest controls the whole story, so he’s basically the main character). Like, it’s exhausting.

So support queer writers, POC writers, female writers, people who write mostly female characters, and so on, please. Especially *now*.

You can read my blogs, books, and other rants here on [my website](https://desdemonawren.com) that I made with my own two hands.

I also have a new book coming out. It’s called **Marjorie Diaz’s Unfortunate Introduction to Magical High Society** to be released late July.

It features POC *MAIN* characters, ace characters, and, yes, **vampires**.
