Just Like Kevin

Disclaimer:*I don’t own JONAS or the market for hilarious song parody names. I’m pretty sure those belong to Disney and Weird Al.*

Summary:*JONAS; Spoilers for episode 7, fashion victim. “I always imagined Kevin smelled like heaven, it must be true, because it rhymes!” Kevin/Macy.*

Author’s notes:*If Kevin and Macy don’t end up becoming canon, I am going to be soooo crushed.*

. . . . . . . .

Macy sat in her room huddled over a huge mess of pictures and craft supplies. She was trying to find a good enough picture of Stella and Van Dyke to turn into a pop up like the one she had of the band JONAS, but she kept getting distracted by thoughts of the Lucas brothers. Or more specifically, Kevin Lucas.

Her mind kept wandering back to the conversation she had with Stella earlier that day. The one where Stella had yammered on about Van Dyke, who in Macy’s professional opinion, was nowhere near the cutest boy in school, but she wasn’t going to tell Stella that. Anyways, during that conversation Macy had interjected Stella’s obsessive talking with some obsessive talking of her own in which she had admitted that she always thought Kevin would smell like heaven. Stella looked freaked out by her obsessive interjection, but said nothing, continuing on with Van Dyke and Macy continued to listen. Even though she had been somewhat distracted by a certain JONAS band member that had captured her eye.

Stella hadn’t noticed her distracted, very distant responses, though. She just continued to talk about Van Dyke and how great he was. Even though it was obvious she didn’t want to be with him as much as she wanted to be with Joe Lucas. It was obvious to everyone but them. Most great relationships were like that. She wondered if she and Kevin were like that. Even though she doubted he even knew anything about her feelings. Well, he might’ve known that she was obsessed with him as, Kevin Lucas a member of JONAS, but not that she had feelings for Kevin Lucas, the boy from school.

After a long time, Macy finally decided on a cute enough picture of Stella and Van Dyke for the pop up and set to work straight away. She couldn’t wait to see Stella’s face when she presented it to her tomorrow. She just hoped by then Stella was still interested in Van Dyke and not some other guy. High school relationships were so fickle. She hoped that she and Kevin would be together for a long time. She couldn’t imagine why they wouldn’t be. Their relationship made perfect sense, but maybe to Stella she and Van Dyke made perfect sense too. Macy sighed, trying not to think about the ups and downs of teen relationships.

. . . . . . .

Stella had been too preoccupied arguing with Joe to receive the pop up she had asked for. So Macy just sat on the stairs, watching them bicker about whatever it was they were fighting about. She was pretty sure that at this point they didn’t even know, but yelling at each other brought out the tension they seemed to have acquired between each other over the years they had been friends.

It was hard seeing her best friend argue with one of the members of her favorite band, but she was too preoccupied with feeling kind of upset that Stella had blown her off and thinking about Kevin. She sighed dreamily, absently wondering what he was doing right that very minute. She was so distracted, in fact, she hadn’t noticed when he came and sat beside her, lifting the Stella/Van Dyke pop up from her lap and opening it.

“Is that Stella and Joe?” He asked suddenly, snapping Macy out of her thoughts as well as snapping Joe and Stella out of their argument. Macy felt the familiar nervousness rise up inside of her and she felt her heart pound. She was practically touching a member of JONAS. He was sitting right next to her, holding a pop up of Joe and Stel-she blinked. Wasn’t that supposed to be Stella and Van Dyke?

“It is,” Nick said, staring over his oldest brother’s shoulder. Macy was frozen, not certain of what kind of reaction she should have to this. All three of the members of JONAS and Stella were staring at her, waiting for some kind of explanation. She was having a very hard time thinking of one. Or even breathing for that matter. Stella reached down and plucked the pop up out of Kevin’s hand and stared at it.

“What is this?” She asked, a little confused. Macy tried to concentrate on breathing. She took a deep breath, reminding herself to stay calm and try to explain to Stella what might’ve happened. And not to ramble. She laughed nervously.

“Well, you see, you asked me to make you a pop up of you and Van Dyke-” she took another deep breath-“and I was distracted last night thinking about Ke-” her forehead creased in frustration. *So much for not rambling, Macy*, she thought before continuing-“Kelp-” that seemed like a good enough excuse, she stole a glance at Kevin who was waiting for her to continue-“you know, that kelp paper for biology that was due? Anyways, I guess I was so distracted thinking about Kev-kelp-“she could’ve kicked herself for almost slipping up again, stupid nerves-“I must’ve mistook Joe for Van Dyke.” She sighed with relief, finally finished with her very long explanation of what might’ve happened.

“What kelp project?” Nick asked, “Don’t we have the same biology class.” Macy could’ve died when he said that. Didn’t he know she was trying to hide the fact that she had been thinking a little too much about Kevin lately?

“It’s…” Macy began, looking at Kevin again, who arched his eyebrow. He was so cute when he did that. She resisted the urge to smile and sigh dreamily and continued, “A special project…for extra credit…I’m doing very poorly in that class.”

“Macy, you have straight A’s,” Stella said. What she wouldn’t give to have a bowing ball right this second. Her heart was pounding wildly now, trying to think of another excuse. This was getting ridiculous. Didn’t they know she was trying not go have a fangirl moment with all three of them…and Stella…being so close to her? Especially Kevin. His brown eyes gazing at her expectantly. It was hard not to get distracted with daydreams.

“I-I…” She said, trying to will herself to faint. It wasn’t working. Well, this was lame. She only fainted when she didn’t want to faint. How exactly was that fair?

“Whatever,” Stella said, finally, staring down at the pop up again and smiling, “It’s kind of cute.” Joe glanced at her.

“You think I’m cute?” He asked. Stella turned to him and glared.

“I didn’t say that,” she spat.

“So you don’t think I’m cute?” Joe asked, sparking a whole new argument between them.

*Ah*, Macy thought, focusing on Joe and Stella, almost forgetting that the two other members of JONAS were right next to her, *Normalcy.*

Ending notes:*I figured I’d end it there. I’ve already written the end, so…I just need to get there…somehow. I have a feeling this is gonna be a long ‘un.*
