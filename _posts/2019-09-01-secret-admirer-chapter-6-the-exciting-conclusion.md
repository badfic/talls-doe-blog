Pretty sure I’m on a roll right now. So I figured, why not update Secret Admirer? Sarah B, this is for you =).

. . . . . . . . .

“This has to be *perfect*,” Stella repeated to Kevin for the *thousandth*time. Kevin sighed,*again*. They were at the firehouse right now, waiting for Macy to be finished with football practice. Stella was glad for the extra time, Kevin wasn’t really looking forward to it.

“I know, Stella,” Kevin said, struggling to stand still while Stella put the finishing touches on the *perfect*outfit for him to confess his feelings for Macy in. He felt like he was getting married.

“I just don’t want my best friend to be disappointed,” Stella said. Kevin frowned, prompting Stella to amend, “Not that she would be, she’s totally into you.”

“Really?” Kevin asked. Stella smiled, pinning something to his vest.

“Totally.”

. . . . . . . . .

“I don’t see why it’s such a huge deal what I wear to meet this guy,” Macy complained as Stella attacked her hair with a curling iron. They were in the locker room and Stella had made a point that Macy had to look absolutely perfect. She felt like she was getting ready to be married off. “I mean, he liked me before I wore this dress…” she trailed off.

“It’s a special occasion, Mace,” Stella pleaded, “Please, just let me have my fun.” Macy sighed and shut up. She knew her best friend was merely trying to do something nice for her, but she felt like she was going against who she really was. Even if the dress Stella had designed was *really*cute. She pressed her fingers against the fabric and smiled at her reflection. She couldn’t *wait*to see who her secret admirer was.

. . . . . . . . .

“How does she look, guys?” Stella asked, presenting Macy to the only two Lucas brothers she had on hand right that second. Joe’s jaw dropped and Nick put his hand over his mouth. Stella waited for them to answer her verbally.

“Whoa,” Joe said, looking Macy up and down.

“She looks *great*, Stella,” Nick said, before adding in his thoughts, *but doesn’t she always?*

“Thanks, guys,” Stella said. Macy remained silent almost the whole time, ready to burst with excitement as she turned towards the door to the atrium.

“Wait a second,” she said, turning back to Stella, Nick and Joe before she entered, “where’s Kevin?” The three of them exchanged glances and then smiles. Macy stood there and waited for them to answer her. When none of them said anything, she spoke again, “I haven’t seen him *all*day.”

“Just go,” Stella said, turning her friend around and pushing her into the atrium. Macy started to protest, but Stella would have none of it. She shoved her best friend the rest of the way through the door and waved to her. Macy glared and mouthed “You better tell me where he is when I’m done here.” Stella only smirked and pointed to the far side where there was someone coming through the other door.

Macy’s heart thundered in her chest, holding her breath as she waited for the door to open all the way, revealing who her secret admirer was. And just like that, Kevin Lucas stood on the other side of the atrium, smiling at her.

“Hey Macy,” he said. There was her answer to where Kevin was.

“Hey, Kevin,” Macy said, a little confused, “what’re you doing here?” Kevin frowned.

“Is it so hard to believe that I’m your secret admirer?” He asked. Macy’s heart almost stopped breathing, she had to remind herself to breathe.

“But you said…you told Stella…you said you didn’t write the notes!” She sputtered. Kevin smiled sadly, crossing the atrium to stand in front of her.

“I didn’t,” he said, “not at first anyway.” He motioned to where Stella, Joe, and Nick were watching, “It was Joe and Nick’s idea; Nick wrote the notes.” Macy turned to look at them. Joe and Nick waved.

“Then…” she said, turning back to Kevin, “is this some kind of joke?” She looked like she was going to cry.

“No!” Kevin shouted, “No, Macy, Joe and Nick were trying to make me jealous enough to admit my feelings for you by becoming your secret admirer, but it backfired when I found out what they were doing. Then they got me to help out, I put the rose on your locker.” Macy bit her lip.

“Oh,” she whispered, “It really was a pretty rose.”

“And,” Kevin continued, “I wrote the last note.” Macy smiled then.

“That one was my favorite,” she said. Kevin smiled then too.

“Really?” He asked, filling with excitement.

“Yeah,” Macy said, eyes locking with his as she continued, “to be honest, I was hoping all along it was you.” Kevin’s heart was pounding now, getting more and more nervous with every second he spent with her. Macy Misa was beautiful, even without all the effort Stella had put into doing her hair and make-up and putting her into that strapless red dress. All that extra stuff only added to Kevin’s nervousness.

“Really?” He asked again, taking a deep breath and rocking back and forth on his feet.

“Yeah,” Macy said again.

Stella was about to pull her hair out in frustration waiting for them to stop dilly-dallying and get on with the kissing. She pressed her hands to her cheeks in frustration. Next to her, Joe was reacting in much the same way. Those two were taking too long. Nick, on the other hand was completely calm, watching as his brother and Macy conversed. He thought it was cute how shy and nervous they were. It was also a bonus that no one had gotten hurt.

“Sooo,” Macy said, looking down at her feet and kicking against the grass nervously, “you really like me?”

“I really, *really* like you,” Kevin said. Macy looked back up at him, twirling one of her ringlets around her finger. A light blush was still spread across her cheeks.

“I really, really like you too,” she whispered.

Stella was going to die with all this suspense. Joe was holding his breath. Nick was humming a possible new song.

Kevin reached a trembling hang out to caress her cheek. Macy’s heart thundered, feeling a spark has his bare flesh touched hers. She exhaled shakily. Kevin took a step closer to her, bringing his other hand up to cup her other cheek and tilting her head back so she was looking up at him.

“Is it okay if I kiss you?” He asked, wanting her permission before he kissed her for the first time.

“I wouldn’t have it any other way,” she responded, her lips parting slightly. Kevin smiled, sighing as he leaned up to kiss her forehead.

Stella wanted to scream in frustration. Joe was practically pulling his hair out at this point. Nick was still humming that song.

Then he kissed the corner of her eye, and then her cheek, and finally, he pressed his lips to hers. At this point, Macy was practically beaming. She couldn’t believe that the *cutest*and *sweetest* boy she had *ever*met was standing there, cradling her face in his hands and *kissing*her.

Stella jumped up and down with glee. Joe did his signature happy dance. And Nick smiled.

Kevin slid his hands from her face, down to her neck, and over her arms before he finally wrapped them around her midsection. Macy smiled against his lips, breathing in his scent as she pressed her hands to his chest.

“This is the most perfect moment of my life,” Kevin whispered when he finally pulled away. Macy smiled and rested her head against his shoulder, his arms still around her.

“Mine too,” she responded, “I’m so glad it was you.”

. . . . . . . . .

Totally ended it on a rhyme. I am SO cool. Don’t forget to take a breath =).
