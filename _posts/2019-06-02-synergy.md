It’s like poetry–  
the way you move me  
like water, like fluid  
the membrane of a cell  
the tiny pieces that make me  
  
You’re like energy–  
the way your sparks flow  
flooding into my veins   
body shaking, electric  
  
I’m like misery–  
when we’re apart  
dead leaves in an  
*endless* forest  
trampled and alone  
under forgotten footsteps  
  
We’re like perfection–  
tangled together between cotton sheets  
stained with tiny beads of sweat  
and heavy breathing  
  
And I’m Home
