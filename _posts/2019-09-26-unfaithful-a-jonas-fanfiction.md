This time it’s a Joella and a Kacy. And yeah, it’s preeettyyy steaaamy. So…prepare to blush.

Dedicated to: Faerietaleredux, who is the *greatest* AU writer *ever* and she gives the most *perfect* reviews!

Unfaithful  
Chapter One  
What he Forgot

BEGIN &amp;&amp;

He didn’t know when he decided that Stella wasn’t enough for him. Sure, she was beautiful, amazing, talented, and a *great* kisser, but now he found himself in a strange position. Well, the position wasn’t *exactly* strange, not *anymore* anyhow. Now the position was *familiar.*

She was pressed between him and a row of lockers, her shirt abandoned somewhere near them. He had ambushed her while she had been changing, capturing her lips with his and shoving her against the cold metal lockers. She had protested at first. He smirked against her lips at the memory.

“Joseph Lucas!” She had yelled, shrilly and he had shushed her, pressing his lips against hers again. “No!” She yelled at him, a giggling rising in her throat as she shoved him away, “I’m *shirtless* and these lockers are *freezing*!” He just smirked at her.

“I’ll help you get warm,” he had said, pressing his body against hers and kissing her again. She didn’t complain once after that.

“Jooooe,” she said, pulling away from him and watching as his smirk faded.

“Not warm enough?” He asked, pouting a little. She giggled and shook her head.

“I’ve got to get dressed sometime, Joseph,” she said. He pouted again, staring down at her lacy pink and black bra.

“I like you better this way,” he said, leaning down to plant a kiss against her throat. She smacked him.

“Only you,” she said, smiling at him as he snaked his arms around her waist and pulled her flush against him. He leaned down, running his tongue along her bottom lip.

“That’s new,” she whispered, a little dazed by his action. Joe smirked at her, tracing his fingertips along her bate back and up to the clasp of her bra. He fingered the clasps, staring directly into her eyes. She frowned, shoving him away.

“Perv,” she responded, holding back a smirk as she made her way over to where her shirt was, “aren’t you getting any from your *girlfriend*?” She asked. Joe narrowed his eyes at her, watching was she leaned over to pick up her shirt, sliding in on and buttoning it up hastily.

“What about you?” He asked, “is your boyfriend satisfying your *needs*.” She looked up at him, a smile playing across her lips.

“If he was able to satisfy me, I wouldn’t need you now, would I?” He stared at her for a long moment, eyes questioning.

“How far have you two gone, anyhow?” He asked, watching her pick up the rest of her things and run a brush through her mussed hair.

“Why?” She asked, “are you *jealous*?” Joe stared at her carefully, watching as she pulled her hair back into a high pony tail and tossed the rest of her belongings haphazardly into her gym bag.

“Do you want me to be?” He asked, deciding that question was the best course of action to take. He didn’t want her to know that he really was jealous that another man was touching her the way he touched her. Well, he didn’t really *know*that for sure, he wasn’t even sure that her boyfriend has it in him to be that intimate.

She stared at him, eyes narrowing and lips parting slightly. She opened her mouth to say something, but before she could get the words out, the locker room door opened.

“Macy?” A familiar voice asked. Joe and the girl exchanged looks, both of them wide-eyed.

“*hide*,” she mouthed to him, picking up her gym bag and heading towards the front of the locker room.

“Stella,” she said, giving her friend a nervous smile, “what are you doing here?” Stella shot her best friend a questioning look, both eyebrows raised.

“I was looking for you,” she responded, “you always take so long in the locker room.” She laughed nervously.

“You know I like to reflect after practice,” she responded, “it’s how I unwind.”

“Well I wish you’d *reflect* faster,” Stella responded, “that way I’d be able to have more time with my best friend. I feel like I hardly see you lately. You’re either *reflecting* or out with Kevin or busy with school and games…” she trailed off.

“Or you’re out with Joe,” Macy added, staring down at the floor and resisting the urge to chew on her lip nervously.

“Yeah,” Stella said with a dreamy smile, “Joe.” Macy felt like she was going to be sick. Stella was her best friend, but she would never be enough for Joe. She didn’t think any one girl would be enough for Joe Lucas.

“Yeah,” Macy responded, “Joe’s great. Can we leave now?” Stella looked down at her best friend and frowned.

“What do you have against Joe?”

“Nothing,” she said, adding bitterly in her thoughts, *but he’s got* me *against days, anyway.* “Why?”

“It’s just,” Stella said, “every time I bring him up you seem to not want to talk about him.”

“Oh,” She said, “I didn’t realize I did that.” *Maybe it’s because I get more than enough of your boyfriend on a daily basis*, she thought, rolling her eyes at the ground as she headed past Stella and towards the entrance of the locker room.

“Well, you do,” Stella said, pulling out her phone to answer a text message, “*a lot*.” Macy rolled her eyes again, bitterly thinking, *I wonder why?* As she made her way towards one of the exits of the school.

“I’m sorry, Stella,” Macy said, giving her friend an apologetic smile as she pushed open the door that lead outside to the parking lot.

“I mean,” Stella continued, “I used to listen to you gush about *Kevin,*all the time. The least you can do is listen to me gush about Joe.” Macy swallowed, thinking about her current boyfriend. The though of him always made her stomach feel like it was in knots. It used to be the same way whenever she hung out with Stella, but that had gotten better now.

“I’m sorry, Stella,” Macy said again, “I’ll listen more, I promise.”

“That’s what you said *last time*, Macy,” Stella said, “And the time before that. And the time before that…and—” Macy cut her best friend off, “I get it, Stells,” she said, “but I mean it this time, I *promise.*“

Stella sighed, glaring at her best friend and rolling her eyes.

“Whatever you say, Mace,” She said, not really believing her. She knew she’d probably blow her off the next time she so much as mentioned her boyfriend. Like, now…

“Wait…” Stella said, “Is that Joe?” She pointed towards the door the two girls had just previously come out of. Macy whirled around, her stomach in knots, her heart racing. What was he? *Stupid?* “I thought he told me he was going home early….”

*Oh God,*Macy thought, watching as he walked nonchalantly towards his car, whistling and jingling his keys.

“Joseph!” Stella called out to him, stepping around her car and glaring at her boyfriend with her hands on her hips. Joe turned and looked at the two of them, his face going white. Macy gave him a “*what the* hell*, Joe?”* look before staring at him wide-eyed. “What are you still doing here?” She asked, “I thought you had to leave *early*.”

“I-uh-forgot something,” he responded, mentally kicking himself for the suspicious “uh” he had allowed to escape between I and forgot.

“Really?” Stella asked, “What’d you forget?” Macy swallowed hard as his eyes shifted from Stella to gaze at her. She shook her head frantically, backing up a little and nodding towards Stella. Was he *retarded*? Stella could totally see that!

“It’s a surprise, Stells,” Joe said, gaze focusing on her once more. Macy hoped she hadn’t seen that. She really hoped she hadn’t.

“What kind of surprise?” Stella asked, still a little skeptical. Joe swallowed, willing himself *not* to look at Macy again. He already had two strikes. He didn’t need another one.

“A surprise to show you what an *amazing* girlfriend you are,” Joe said, grinning at her and winking. Stella couldn’t help but smile at that.

“What is it?” She asked, a smile still present on her lips.

“If I told you, it wouldn’t be a surprise, would it?” Stella’s smile faded.

“When am I getting my surprise?” Stella asked, eyes narrowing at him.

“Soon,” he responded, “very soon.” Joe flashed her another smile and walked the final few steps to his car, unlocking it and opening the door.

“You know I’m not patient, Joe,” Stella said, frowning.

“I know,” he responded, sliding into the driver’s seat and shutting the door. Stella sighed, aggravated by his action and turning to Macy.

“Why the *hell* did he look at you when I asked him what he had forgotten?” Macy didn’t know what to say to that. Her stomach was in knots and she felt like she might vomit right then and there.

“I don’t know,” she said, surprising herself when she didn’t even miss a beat, “Joe’s always been weird.”
