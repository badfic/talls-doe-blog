laying back  
eyes closed  
d r i f t i n g away   
against your chest  
your heartb e a t  
lures me d ee p e r  
into a land of dreams  
and happy memories  
that only e x i s t when  
you’re *holding* me  
and telling me “sleep now my  
**p r i n c e s s**”  
in that sweet calm voice while  
you run your fingers through my  
*hair* and kiss my forehead  
and in my dreams  
these moments  
never end.
