Here’s some fanart I did for Marjorie Diaz of Cessily and Adorara. They’ve sort of become fan favorites so I figured I gotta draw my two favorite lesbians.

(My other favorite lesbian is Lucian because Adorara is bi/pansexual)

#### More about [Marjorie Diaz](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FBWBDYR?ref_=pe_3052080_276849420)

**Girl meets boy. Girl falls in love with boy. Boy hunts girl for sport.**

Marjorie Diaz has no idea who Patrick Watkins is. When he saunters into her senior seminar class during her last semester of college, the last thing she expects is to fall in love with him.   
  
She’s swept up into a whirlwind—and often times fairytale-esque—romance. That is, until his family kidnaps her and sends her to a place she never thought she would go again.   
  
Now, with the help of her best friend Lucian Maravalle, she has to run for her life, and try not to think too hard about the fact that all of the important people in her life has been keeping a dangerous secret. A secret that could cost Marjorie her life.  
  
Book one in the Marjorie Diaz series.
