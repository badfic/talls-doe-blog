I’m laying here awake  
Naked  
Skin soft and supple  
Lips wet  
Fingers on your chest  
Cheek against your shoulder  
Ripe  
Sweet  
Open  
And you’re checking your phone  
For things that will never be  
While I’m here next to you  
Ready to be plucked from the stem  
Heart racing  
Heated  
And pleading  
But you  
You’re too far gone  
No matter how many nights you hold me  
Beg me not to go  
Smooth my hair over my shoulders  
Kiss my forehead  
Placate my whimpering trembling body  
You’re never you  
Not anymore  
You’re just a shell  
Hunched over your phone  
Next to the  
Sweetest fruit you’d ever eat  
Escaping to the things that bitterness is made of  
Just to pretend to feel whole again  
Like you never will  
Without me.
