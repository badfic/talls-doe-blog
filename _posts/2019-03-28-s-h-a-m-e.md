but a/hamed of me

about the symmetry  
of your face  
and t/e way your  
/air curls just right  
around your ears

## A

/nd /nother /nd /nother  
until /ll th/t’s left is bones  
ground to dust  
–/nd my love for you

## M

The first day of fall  
and all I want to do  
is hold your hand.

about /vrything
