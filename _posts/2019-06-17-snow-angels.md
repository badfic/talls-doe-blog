A flurry of southern snow and on Christmas no less  
Seen from a lit window, the first snow flakes during  
the famous gift exchange  
  
“It’s snowing!” An excited exclamation   
and to the window two sets of feet traveled quickly  
the room was full of awe and wonder  
coats were drawn,   
scarves flung around throats haphazardly  
  
And the snow angels danced, spinning with the crystals  
of white and purity and the world feels cleansed  
  
You say, “lay down, I’ll show you something beautiful”  
I oblige, and you take the snowy ground next to me,  
lace your fingers between mine…  
and we make snow angel lovers  
  
You tell me, “I want to make these with you forever”  
and I tell you, “that’s how long we’ll wait for another miracle.”
