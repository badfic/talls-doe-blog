Listen. Listen. Listen.  
You never LISTEN  
and I tell you things  
I just want you to  
hear.  
Me.  
SCREAMING.

Catch me when I fall from grace?  
you’re never there to see my entrance  
the dance of shadows on my chest  
the rocks bleed me dry.

You’d kiss me if I weren’t  
so.  
Crazy.  
You called me your little  
“Bellatrix” and I   
I didn’t know  
but I understand.

You’d love me if I wasn’t   
so far  
**gone**  
that you don’t know who   
**I am**.

listen. Listen. LISTEN. **LISTEN**. **LISTEN**  
you. never. hear. me.   
nevergetit. never get it.

I. can’t. anymore.
