I haven’t updated this in like five days. I haven’t been in much of a Kacy mood. Considering I’m kind of peeved at Kevin. Grr.

Just Like Kevin

Chapter Six

. . . . . . . . .

Macy was having trouble sleeping, her thoughts drifting off to a million scenarios on what *might* happen when Kevin picked her up in the morning. Her heart was racing at the prospect of it. She rolled over and checked the clock by her bed. The readout warned her that it was now officially 5am and she only had two more hours to sleep. She rolled back over and groaned, trying to clear her mind of all things Kevin and go to sleep. She couldn’t do it. He had practically taken over her thoughts.

An hour and a half later, Macy gave up trying to sleep. She got up and stomped around her room, rummaging through her clothing and trying to find which uniform would be the perfect one to wear. She figured if she wasn’t going to sleep, she might as well look good when he came to get her. Stella would be proud. She was still trying to pick out what she should wear when he alarm clock went off, warning her that she only had an hour to finish getting ready for school. She grabbed the first thing she had been considering and ran towards her bathroom. Today was going to be interesting to say the least.

. . . . . . . . . .

Kevin showed up at her house at 8am on the dot. And, like a gentleman, he came to the door and waited for her downstairs. Macy rushed downstairs to meet him, her foot catching on the last step. She cried out as she fell, closing her eyes and bracing herself for impact, but she didn’t hit the floor. Instead-she opened her eyes-she ended up in Kevin’s arms. That was the second time she’d been in his arms. Her face flushed and she looked down at her feet.

“Whoops,” she muttered, blush still present on her face. Kevin chuckled.

“You okay?” He asked, helping her get back onto her feet. She nodded, still blushing and looking down. This was a lousy start to the day she spent daydreaming about throughout all last night. “You sure?” He asked, genuinely concerned for her welfare.

“I’m sure,” she said, turning her face up so her eyes could meet his.

*Big mistake*, she thought breathlessly, *big, big, big, big,bigmistake.* Kevin stared back at her, unaware of her condition. She swayed slightly, breaking his gaze and staring down at her carpet.

“We should go,” she said, walking towards the door. He grabbed her wrist.

“Wait,” he said, spinning her so that she was facing him. Macy swallowed hard, keeping her eyes on his shoes. His very nice, probably really expensive, shoes. “Before we go…” he trailed off a bit, staring down at her and wondering silently why she was staring at his shoes, “what did you want to ask me last night?”

“I…I,” she sputtered, “I don’t remember…” Kevin stared at her in confusion.

“Come on, Macy,” Kevin said, “we’re friends, you can ask me anything.” Macy’s heart broke when he told her she was his *friend*. She didn’t know why that hurt so much, but she was guessing it had something to do with the fact that she wanted to be so much more than friends with him.

“I already got your answer then,” she responded, turning away from him and heading towards the door where her satchel was. Kevin was even more confused at this point. What answer? What was she even talking about? Instead of voicing his confusion, though, he followed after her, through her front door and to his car.

Kevin opened the door for her, just like he had done the previous day and waited for her to get all the way in before he closed it. Macy sighed as she waited for him to make his way around the car to the driver’s side. Her heart felt crushed, she couldn’t believe that she had waited all night for nothing. She had to laugh a little when she realized how emo she sounded. She hoped this whole emotional kick was just her being cranky.

Kevin got into the car and turned to look at her. She stared out the windshield, refusing to meet his gaze. He sighed and started the car, backing out of her driveway and heading towards the school.

For most of the ride there, they were silent. But finally, it was Kevin who broke it.

“Macy,” he said, glancing at her out of the corner of his eye, “I, uh,” he said, biting his lip, “I still want to know what that question was.” She didn’t answer. “Macy?” He asked, stopping at a stop sign and turning to look directly at her while he waited in a line of cars to make it to their school. Her eyes were closed and her head was leaning against his window. He smiled softly. She must’ve had a bad night.

When he got to the school he parked and checked the time. They had a few more minutes, he noticed, turning back to look at the still sleeping Macy. He didn’t want to have to wake her up. She looked so cute like that. Her damp hair was sticking to her face, her pink lips slightly parted, her eyes shut softly. He sighed, smiling at the sight of her asleep next to him.

He wondered if she would be upset if he just let her sleep. He decided she wouldn’t be too upset, so long as he stayed with her.
