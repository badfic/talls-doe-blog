you’d rather i be

> m e dICATED

and normal, simple, dead   
in my eyes  
(you want them to be *void*  
of sparkle and hope, grace, compassion)

you think it’d be *easier*  
if i never felt the things rising to the surface  
bubbling and causing the sweet upward curl  
of my lips.

you wish i was flat, emotionless, *broken*  
you choke me on those pills  
tell me it’s *helping* me to be NORMAL  
but all it does is bring the   
*numbness* back and force me   
**under** the perpetual shade of  
**darkness** behind my eyelids.

i’ll never be normal enough for you.
