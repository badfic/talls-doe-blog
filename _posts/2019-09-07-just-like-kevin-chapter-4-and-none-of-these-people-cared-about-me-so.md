This is for irrevocablyamanduh and suburbs who inspire me so much. Oh, and thiscoffeeshop too, who reminded me that I need to update this like…a week ago. And keeps me incredibly entertained with all of her *awesome* JONAS stories.

Just Like Kevin

Chapter Four

. . . . . . . .

When they got to the car, Macy watched with wide eyes as Kevin stopped beside the passenger door, opening it and stepping aside for her to get in.

“Th-thanks, Kev,” She whispered as she ducked into the passenger seat of his car. He lingered by her door, making sure she was all the way in before he shut it and made his way to the driver’s side, opening his own door and climbing into the car.

“Where do you live?” He asked, putting his keys into the ignition and putting his seat belt on. Macy swallowed hard, clearing her throat and giving him the directions to her house. Kevin listened intently before he backed out of his parking space and the two of them left the school.

For most of the ride, they were silent. Macy was almost dying of nervousness and Kevin was trying to think of something to say. He watched out of the corner of his eye as she played with the sleeves of his jacket.

“Are you still cold?” He asked, reaching towards the heater to turn it up. Instinctively, Macy reached out and grabbed his hand to stop him from turning up the heater. It was hot enough in there already. She blushed at that thought.

“No,” she responded, “I’m not cold anymore, thanks.”

“Oh,” Kevin responded, looking at where her small hand was still wrapped around his and then back to the road and then back again. Macy looked at him and then in the direction he had just glanced, realizing that she was still holding his hand. She gasped, releasing it and turning her face towards the window so she could blush in peace.

“Sorry,” she muttered, still staring out the window.

“It’s okay,” Kevin said, smiling to himself. She wanted to hold his hand, that was definitely a plus. Joe would be proud. Macy composed herself and turned away from the window to look at him.

“Are you sure?” She asked, willing herself not to blush again.

“Yeah,” Kevin responded. Macy bit her lip. This whole day was starting to get even more awkward-if that was even humanly possible at this point. An awkward silence settled over them, both of them wracking their brains for something to say.

“Uh,” Macy and Kevin said together. Kevin turned and looked at her for a second before turning back to the road. He smiled a little, laughing. Macy laughed too.

“What were you going to say?” Kevin asked, turning onto her road.

“I don’t know,” Macy responded, laughing again, “It was just too quiet.”

“Yeah,” Kevin said, “which house is yours?”

“Keep going,” Macy said, “it’s a long way down.”

“Oh,” Kevin said, turning slightly to smile at her, “gives us more time to talk.” He winked at her and she blushed, staring down at her feet.

“What did you want to talk about?” She asked, playing with the sleeves on his jacket again.

*How cute you look in that jacket*, He thought, smirking to himself.

“How was practice?” He asked, trying to keep the conversation light.

“Oh,” Macy said, sucking on her bottom lip, Kevin caught that out of the corner of his eye and inhailed sharply, “Not so great.”

“Why’s that?” Kevin asked. Macy swallowed, pulling on the cuffs of his jacket nervously. What was she supposed to tell him? “*I was too busy thinking about you to concentrate on playing basketball?*” Or “*I was thinking of how hot yo-*” Her face flushed and she cleared her throat, trying to push that thought from her mind.

“I couldn’t concentrate,” she muttered, cheeks flushing more.

“Why?” He asked.

*Oh god,*Macy thought. She had been afraid of that question.

“I’ve had a lot on my mind lately,” she admitted.

“Like what?” He asked. What? Was he *determined*to get *something*out of her? Macy turned and stared at him in disbelief.

“Just *stuff*, Kevin,” She said in a way that told him not to ask about it anymore. Kevin got her hint and changed the subject.

“You took a long time in the shower…” He said and Macy looked at him with him, eyebrows raised. Kevin mentally kicked himself for that statement. Now she was going to think he was stalking her or something.

“Did you time me?” She asked, an amused look on her face.

*Yes,*Kevin thought, “No,” he said, trying not to look nervous. He was just bored.

*That’s why you waited for her?* His mind practically screamed at him. His nostrils flared and he sighed. He knew he wasn’t going to be able to convince himself that he waited for her after practice because he wanted to be friends with her, but that didn’t mean he was ready to admit what he really felt. Especially since he didn’t think Macy felt the same way.

He snuck a glance at her and she was still staring at him, same amused expression on her face. He wondered what she was thinking about.

“Stop!” Macy said. Kevin slammed on the brakes, and stared at her.

“What?” He asked, eyes wide. Macy blushed a little.

“This is my house,” she responded, pointing to the driveway to the left of him.

“Oh,” he responded, turning the car so he could pull up into her driveway.

“Thanks for the ride,” Macy said once he had stopped, unbuckling her seat belt and getting out of the car before he could even manage to put it in park.

“Macy, wait!” He called, rolling down her window. Macy stopped and turned around to look at him.

“Yeah?” She asked, really wanting to get away from this whole situation. She was starting to feel nervous again. This was crazy.

“Can I pick you up in the morning?” He blurted, mentally kicking himself again.

“Oh,” Macy said, her face flushing, “Yeah…okay…”

“Cool,” Kevin said, flashing her a smile. Macy smiled back at him and turned around to walk to her front door. “One more thing…” Kevin said, not willing to let her go yet.

“Yeah?” Macy asked, turning back around. She wished he would just hurry up and go, didn’t ge know how nervous this whole situation was making her?

“Can I call you tonight?” Macy’s heart almost stopped beating.

“U-uh…” She stuttered, “I…you don’t have my number…” And she was pretty sure she couldn’t remember it right now.

“I can get it from Stella,” he offered. Macy blushed again, her heart pounding. Kevin Lucas of JONAS wanted to call her. This…this…she didn’t even know *what*this was.

“Oh,” she said, flashing him an uncertain smile, “Okay, sure.” Kevin smiled back, rolling up the window and backing out of her driveway as she ran to her front door.

*Oh god,*she thought once she was inside of her house, leaning against the front door in order to catch her breath, *this has to be the most embarrassing day of my life.*

. . . . . . . . .

Yeah. OOC. I don’t know what happened really. I’m just kind of sitting here and going “Maybe they should deny their feelings for awhile. That seems fun.” I really hope this is okay D:. I’m kind of not impressed with this chapter.
