Have you ever been so in love  
that his smile is your lullaby,  
his eyes are your night sky,  
he overtakes your dreams.  
  
Have you ever been so in love  
that he steals your breath  
his hair comes in whispers  
sweet caresses on your cheek.  
  
Have you ever been so in love  
that his laugh is your morning song  
sweet melody carried by the wind  
hitting your ear in sweet rhythmic tones.  
  
Have you ever been so in love  
that he’s the soundtrack of your summer  
every song you hear makes you think of him  
in everything you write, he has a place.  
  
Have you ever been so in love  
that you get butterflies when you see him  
even if you just catch a glimpse  
see him for a fleeting moment.  
  
Have you ever been so in love  
that his heartbeat is the rhythm you live by  
that you can’t go a single moment without the thought  
of your cheek pressed against his chest  
the steady rhythm of his heart  
the warmth of his touch.  
  
Have you ever been so in love  
that you want to know everything about him  
you hang on every word  
love his imperfections  
love him with all your heart.  
  
Have you ever been so in love  
that it hurts; good and bad.  
he overtakes you, breaks you  
you’ve memorized the way he walks.  
  
Have you ever  
 been so in love  
 *that he can break your heart?*  
with just one word.
