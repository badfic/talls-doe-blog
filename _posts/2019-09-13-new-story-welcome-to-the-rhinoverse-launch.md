So if you follow me on Twitter, you’ll know I’ve been developing an interactive online serial about a girl with supernatural bad luck named Rhine Tseng.

And what better day to release that then Friday the 13th, right?

You can find the first blog post [here](https://rhinoverse.desdemonawren.com), but if you’re not completely convinced yet, read the synopsis below. I promise you will not be disappointed.

### Official Welcome to the Rhinoverse Synopsis

Rhine Tseng is the most unlucky girl in the world. Her bad luck is next level, it’s supernatural, it’s sentient. She can feel it grow and consume and want from inside of her. Which is sort of putting a damper on her plans to rule the world by the time she’s 30.

Not that she’s complaining, better her than someone else less equipped for the loneliness that comes with being the world’s biggest bad luck charm.

So far everything has worked out mostly okay for her. She’s a junior at UCLA, a genius statistician, and she’s an intern for the most prestigious company in the world, Kincaid Co.

But the other shoe is about to drop, throwing a curve ball of epic proportions. Rhine will have to race against the clock and battle an unseen enemy, a being that has always been a part of her, in order to prevent the end of the world.

I am so excited to be sharing this with all of you. This has been a few years in the making now and honestly it’s one of my favorite stories I’ve written. So please, enjoy!

Without further ado, [Welcome to the Rhinoverse](https://rhinoverse.desdemonawren.com).
