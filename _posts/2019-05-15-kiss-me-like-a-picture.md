I can taste you

how bad I wish

you were mine

but I’ve already

watched your

dark brown hair

and blonde/purple/pink

high lights slip

through my fingers

and walk away

with words that

tore my heart free

loosened amongst

my insides.

You were an

angel maybe once

mine but not now

as I watch you

hunched over

your desk

and interested

in your work

like I don’t

matter.

Everyone wants you

I’m not sure why

you’re so universal

right? You’re so

beautiful that

you can have

everyone and

everything and

you like to play

with feelings

but maybe I

do too and…

maybe that’s why

I still keep

your pictures

and your kisses

close to my

&lt;3.
