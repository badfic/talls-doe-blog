Admit it  
it’s euphoric to see me this way:  
lips chapped  
nose red  
mouth agape  
throat so raw  
air feels like sandpaper  
in my lungs

it brings you happiness  
to see me grovel  
beg, *long*  
for your affection

*Please, please, please*  
don’t leave me

but…  
you do   
  
&amp;  
it fills you with joy  
to know that you’ve created a void  
an ache in my chest bigger than  
the one I caused you

you keep biting at me  
insults through letters and words  
but I sit here &amp;  
wait…  
just to be close to you

but…  
I’m nothing to you or anyone else  
I’m here   
bro  
 ken   
&amp; you love it  
  
but I’m the selfish one  
so hurt me  
because you don’t deserve me  
  
maybe one day I’ll wake up  
after everything you’ve done to erase me  
and realize I deserve better  
  
but for now  
I’m begging with chapped lips  
and a sandpaper throat:  
  
*don’t go.*
