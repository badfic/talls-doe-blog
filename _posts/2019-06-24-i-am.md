i am :

> emotions on sleeves. heart on the outside looking in.  
> stained glass, cracked, but unbroken. tears in the darkness of   
> SUMMER.

i am :

> terrified of losing you. tied up in moments of  
> complicated and time and waiting. miserable at best.

i am :

> yours and no one else’s. it’s so easy to wait  
> to make things simple. to imagine touching your skin with the flesh of  
> my lips.

i am :

> waiting for time to stand still. hoping for a moment  
> that might never come, but i was never one to doubt in love (*but we  
> **all** know that’s a lie*).

i am :

> <sub>the saddest rainbow at the end of summer. stained  
> glass painted dull and lifeless.</sub>
> 
> **BUTTER –  
>  FLIES** <sub>  
> with you around.</sub>
> 
>   
> i am :   
> *unbroken, the stars in the sky.*
