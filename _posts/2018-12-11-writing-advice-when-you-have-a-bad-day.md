I don’t have anything that anyone expressly asked me today, but I was reading a few blogs yesterday because I was feeling really down on myself. To date, I haven’t written very many creative works that have been published. I have a whole ton of published news stories and blogs, but nothing creative.

I just want to tell everyone that it’s okay to not have a lot of creative works published and still be working on a book. There are a ton of people out there that never wrote anything prior to writing some of the most famous books we have in existence. J.K Rowling and Stephen King come to mind.

It’s never too late to get started. Write the book that keeps you up at night and don’t worry about what other writers are doing. Your success is not measured by their success.
