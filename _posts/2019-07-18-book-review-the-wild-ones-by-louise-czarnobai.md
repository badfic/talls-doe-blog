I was actually a beta on this story for most of last year! The BEST Beta. Ask anyone.

Where do I even begin with my praise for this excellent book? The way Czarnobai eases us into this incredible supernatural world astounds me. The lead-in at the beginning with what is, essentially, a state of the union address was absolutely sublime.

He’s a secret super who tries to help other supers get off of insane charges with his law degree. However, because of this, he gets into a little trouble himself. This is what leads him to SINS and ultimately to the stunningly sexy, Lucas.

And once those two get together it is allll downhill from there. In a good way, that is. Their sexual tension and bantering really had me hooked! It was impossible to look away from all of their spicy encounters. I found myself almost to the point of frustration, screaming at my Kindle for them to kiss.

I wish there had been more SINS stuff in there, though! I can’t wait for the second book with more epic action and romance.

An excellent debut for Louise Czarnobai.
