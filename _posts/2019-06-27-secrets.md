You’re magic, electric  
vibrancy, butterflies, dizziness  
the sparkles in the sky  
the rain I watched for hours  
with that dumb smile on my face.  
  
You’re waiting, time  
slowly   
 tick –   
tock –   
tocking   
*away*.  
  
You’re a lot, meaningful  
but once upon  
a time  
you were (*this  
is a secret, our secret…*)  
the **pain** that  
I thought was *love*.  
  
You’re fireworks, explosions  
of light and heat  
inside my head **&amp;**  
you’re fire on my skin  
but (*and this is a **secret**  
my secret…*)  
I’m afraid to let this be  
what it is.  
  
<sub>because I’m still waiting for you to break my heart.</sub>
