My demons  
 Are white hot  
 Chill me to the bone  
 Fear

 Its paralyzing  
 I can feel it in my sleep  
 In my dreams

 The fear chases away  
 The light, happiness  
 My heart is filled with black clouds  
 Of pain and constant  
 Constant  
 Constant  
 Fear

 Some days I can’t function  
 Because I am so afraid  
 Of everything  
 Because my demons  
 Chase me  
 Until I can’t run  
 There’s nowhere to hide  
 The darkness is everywhere  
 Because my demons  
 Are determined

 I lay my head down  
 And I try to hide  
 Wishing for the days when  
 I had nightmares about driverless cars  
 And no constant sense of   
 IMPENDING DOOM  
 And of my own mortality

 I miss the nightmares  
 With the bathroom stalls  
 The light that chased the fear away  
 Now I can’t even sleep with the   
 Bathroom door open  
 Lest the monsters get out  
 Lest they bleed into reality  
 Lest they come out of my head  
 Free of my imagination

 Because they are coming  
 I feel it in my fear  
 Because why  
 Why would so much fear be for  
 Nothing

 Why would it take over   
 So completely  
 If there’s nothing  
 Nothing to be afraid of  
 Because my demons  
 Are real
