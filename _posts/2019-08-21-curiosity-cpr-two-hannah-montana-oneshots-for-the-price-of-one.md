***i. Curiousity***

**Summary:** Curiousity killed the cat. OxM ONESHOT

Miley sighed deeply as she lay on her bed and stared up at the ceiling; on the other side of her room in a chair, sat her best friend Oliver.

“This is so boring, Oliver,” Miley complained as she stretched her hand out in front of her face and examined it.

“It’s so nice you think hanging out with me is boring,” Oliver said sullenly. Miley sat up then and shot him a look.

“I didn’t mean it like *that*,” Miley said, her voice dangerously bordering on anger. Oliver only shrugged and avoided her eyes.

After awhile an uncomfortable silence engulfed the two slowly. Each of them seemed to fear the sound of their own voices for a second, until Miley broke the ice, “What’s wrong Oliver?” She asked. Her voice sounded weird to her for some reason, but she just brushed it off.

“Nothing,” Oliver said, still not meeting her eyes. A groan escaped Miley’s lips as she felt her legs stand up involuntarily.

Before she knew it, her hands were on either side of Oliver’s face, forcing him to look up at her. She asked her earlier question of ‘what’s wrong?’ yet again; this time she received a head shake.

“I can’t read your mind Oliver,” Miley said impatiently. He met her eyes then, and something about his gaze made Miley nervous.

“I’m just confused is all,” Oliver said, his hands reaching up and touching Miley’s that were still on his face.

Miley’s heart pounded uncomfortably in her chest as she dropped her hand’s to her side and backed away from him until she hit her bed and fell backwards onto it.

“How confused?” She asked suddenly; her voice was barely above a whisper.

She heard him stand up at her statement and walk towards her. Out of both fear and curiosity, Miley didn’t move; even when she felt him lay on her bed next to her, gripping her hand in his.

“This confused,” he whispered. His breath was hot against her cheek and she turned towards him then, her heart beating rapidly as she felt his lips touch hers softly.

She felt her hands begin to shake as they reached up and touched his face after she had rolled over to face him. His hands slid around her waist as he planted soft kisses on her lips.

Both of their hearts were pounding in turn with each other and it was the most beautiful moment either of them has ever experienced; until their heard that old familiar noise of Lily entering into Miley’s room and her voice filled their ears.

“Hey guys, sorry I’m late,” she said with her back to them as they both sat up quickly and Oliver sped off to his chair on the other side of the room and Miley began to fix her hair quickly, but it was too late…Lily had already turned around.

“What happened to you two?” She asked with a laugh. Both Miley and Oliver laughed nervously then before saying and unison, “Curiosity.”

“CPR?” Oliver asked with a raised eyebrow; both Lilly and Miley shrugged at his question then.

“Seems kinda silly huh?” Miley asked, her eyes locking with Oliver’s briefly before they both blushed and turned away from each other. Lilly caught this and sighed.

“What is *wrong* with you two?” Lilly asked before placing her hands on her hips, “ever since you two where alone…in…” her voice trailed off then as her brain began to make the connection.

“OH MY GOSH YOU DIDN’T!” Lilly bellowed, receiving glances she didn’t seem to notice.

“Didn’t *what* Lilly?” Miley asked, trying to keep her cool as a light blush formed across her cheeks.

“YOU DID!” Lilly screamed, attracting unwanted attention to the group once more.

“Did *what*?” Oliver asked, trying to sound genuinely confused even when the light blush formed on his cheeks. Lilly turned to him and her lips parted slightly with a soft smacking noise.

“You *kissed* her,” she breathed into his face. Oliver took a step backwards then, almost knocking over a jewelry display that was right behind him.

“I did not,” Oliver said coolly. He was willing the blush to go away now, but it only got worse.

“You did,” Lilly said with a toothy smile.

“He didn’t,” Miley said as her voice finally returned to her; it sounded strange not, like it was forced. Lilly stared at her then, but Miley avoided Lilly’s eyes and stared over her head at Oliver’s now relieved face.

“Miley,” Lilly said with a pout on her lips.

“Lilly,” Miley said sternly.

“You’re my best friend; I thought we told each other everything!”

“You are Lilly, and we do,” Miley said, stepping forward and taking Lilly’s hand, “don’t you think if I has kissed Oliver—”Miley made a face at that—”I would have told you?” Lilly narrowed her eyes.

“I don’t know,” Lilly said before adding, “out of embarrassment you *might* not.” Miley rolled her eyes.

“Kissing Oliver is not embarrassing…” Miley said with a laugh before adding, “He’s actually a pretty good—” Miley cut herself off as both she and Oliver froze.

“How would you know?” Lilly asked as she raised a blonde eyebrow. Miley and Oliver exchanged looked and then shrugged, “CPR,” they said together with wide smiles.

“CPR?” Lilly asked confused.

“Silly isn’t it?” Oliver asked, and the three headed off down the mall walkway and towards the foot court.

“It really is,” Miley replied back as her fingers brushed Oliver’s and their hands laced together briefly.

“It really is,” Oliver repeated in a whisper.
