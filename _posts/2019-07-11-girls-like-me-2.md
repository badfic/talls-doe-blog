Girls like me,  
don’t fall in love  
we watch love happen.

Girls like me,  
wait for love  
want love  
*give* love  
but do not receive love.

Girls like me,  
are not meant to be loved  
we are meant to watch   
and help love happen.

Girls like me,  
try for love and fail.

Girls like me,  
die alone  
and bro- -ken.

Girls like me,  
will love, giving all of ourselves,  
but will not receive it’s warmth in return.

We will cry  
but we will not receive comfort  
we will bleed  
but the bleeding will never stop.

Girls like me,  
want to be loved  
but no one will love us.

We will write about love,  
we will dream about love,  
we will love love  
but we will never feel it.

Girls like me,  
end up alone.
