## [Hello everyone! Friendly reminder that I’ve got a new book out about vampires with an ace MC and a full cast of POC characters. It’s even on KU if you’ve got it. So.](https://amazon.com/dp/B07FBWBDYR)

**Description:**

## Girl meets boy. Girl falls in love with boy. Boy hunts girl for sport.

Marjorie Diaz has no idea who this guy, Patrick Watkins, is. When he saunters into her senior seminar class during her last semester of college, the last thing she expected was to fall in love with him.

She’s swept up into a whirlwind—and often times fairytale-esque—romance. That is until his family kidnaps her and her entire world turns upside down.

With the help of her best friend Lucian Maravalle, she has to run for her life, and try not to think too hard about the fact that the secrets everyone has been keeping from her, could very well cost her everything.

Oh, and that vampires are real and she’s managed to unwittingly piss off a whole family of them.

Book one in the Marjorie Diaz series.
