This book was an experience for me. As someone who suffered through abuse and self-harm I could identify with this very well. The descriptions of Charlie falling apart weighed heavily in my heart as I listened. So too did her need to run away.

This story is so important. Hearing from someone who has scars the reason why we put them there was as rewarding as it was difficult.

Glasgow so accurately describes what it’s like to feel like you’re drowning in your own mental anguish. This book was so…it for me. It was so good. I can’t even begin to explain how it made me feel.

This was so well done. I will definitely be reading more Kathleen Glasgow in the future.

Charlotte Davis is in pieces. At seventeen she’s already lost more than most people lose in a lifetime. But she’s learned how to forget. The broken glass washes away the sorrow until there is nothing but calm. You don’t have to think about your father and the river. Your best friend, who is gone forever. Or your mother, who has nothing left to give you.

Every new scar hardens Charlie’s heart just a little more, yet it still hurts so much. It hurts enough to not care anymore, which is sometimes what has to happen before you can find your way back from the edge.
