Secret Admirer

Disclaimer:*I don’t own JONAS, but I always say that :P.*

Summary:*JONAS; Macy’s got a secret admirer. Macy x Her secret admirer (one of the Lucas brothers).*

Author’s Notes:*You guys are going to have to wait to find out who is putting notes in her locker. It’s one of the members of JONAS. Hope you like it :).*

. . . . . . . .

Macy Misa skipped up to her locker where her best friend Stella was waiting for her. Stella watched as she did the combination, opening the door, and even when a note fell out and into the floor at her best friend’s feet. Macy watched it flutter to the floor before she bent down and picked it up, opening it and reading what it said.

“It’s a poem,” she said to Stella, looking up from the letter.

“Let me see,” She said, holding out her hand to receive the poem, “who is it from?” Macy handed the poem to Stella.

“At the bottom it says “your secret admirer”,” Macy said, before continuing dreamily, hands over her heart, “I’ve never had a secret admirer before…Who do you think it is?” Stella was quiet for a long time, reading over the poem.

“I’m not…sure,” she said, handing the note back to Macy.

“Do you think it’s Brad?” Macy asked, excitedly, “Or Micheal? Or Dillon? Or Andrew? Or-” she gasped, “One of the members of JONAS?” Stella stared at her.

“Just said I didn’t know,” Stella said, “Guess we’ll have to wait and see if you get another poem.” Macy stared at her best friend for a few moments, eyes narrowing.

“Was it you, Stell?” Macy asked. Stella laughed.

“I’m flattered you think I’d pull a prank like this, but no, it wasn’t me.” Macy’s eyes narrowed more.

“Okay then,” she said after a few seconds, “I believe you.” She shut her locker and turned to walk down the hall to the gym, carrying her fencing supplies. Stella walked after her, wincing when she saw Joe cross her path and Macy ran right into him, falling onto the floor. Well, it was better than her whacking him with her foil. That would’ve hurt.

“Whoa there,” Joe said, “You alright?” Macy looked up at him and promptly forgot to breathe. She started making high pitched squealy noises and Joe clenched his jaw. Stella laughed nervously.

“Breathe, Macy,” she reminded her best friend, “Joe is a person just like you and me.” Macy took a deep breath and held it. “After you take a breath you exhale, Macy,” Stella said. Macy exhaled and took another breath.

“Can I help you up?” Joe asked once she seemed stable, offering her his hand. Macy squealed.

“Joe of JONAS is helping me up,” she said with a giggle, grabbing his hand and letting him pull her to her feet. It was all down hill from there.

Once Macy was finally on her feet, she noticed how dangerously close her whole body was to Joe. She swallowed, staring at where her hands were on his chest, with his over hers and then she looked up at him, face flushed. It didn’t look like she was breathing anymore either. She bit her bottom lip and stared into his eyes shyly, Joe stared back, feeling something change between them. Stella cleared her throat, snapping them both out if it. They jumped apart and laughed nervously.

“Well, that was awkward…” Joe muttered, “Nice seeing you Macy, Stella.” With that, he walked off to find his brothers. Macy turned and stared at Stella with wide eyes.

“What if Joe put that poem in my locker?” She asked in an excited whisper.

“I doubt it,” Stella said, “Joe isn’t the type to do that.”

Ending Notes:*Who is her admirer? The world may never know. I’ll update Fly With Me tomorrow if the mood strikes, I kind of like the idea of ending it where it is…but… :).*
