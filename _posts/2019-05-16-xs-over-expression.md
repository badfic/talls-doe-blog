I feel censored beneath  
the crippling weight of  
everything that is expected of me.  
  
To be upright and   
correct, to live under  
the eyes of scrutiny  
to not deviate from   
the path I haven’t  
even *chosen*.

I am who I am and I’m  
*tired* of being someone different  
for everyone else  
it wears me away fast  
and all I am is bones;  
e(x)pressionless against  
sand.

Bones so lost and broken  
no one will even question  
where I’ve gone or  
why I was never beautiful  
or eye-catching  
or why I’m bent and  
unrecognizable.

I’m gone and no one  
even spares a second  
glance.
