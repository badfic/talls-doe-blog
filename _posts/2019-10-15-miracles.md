I’m standing here  
bathed in the light from the hallway  
still waiting for you to come back  
to say thank you  
to love me again like you used to  
but deep down I know you’re never coming back  
because you’re angry and I’m angry too  
because I hate you and you hate me too  
because there’s nothing we could’ve done  
but just waited for each other  
and you’ve moved on  
but I’m still stuck here  
like a ghost  
loving you  
and you’re out there searching for other things  
and still missing the point  
of someone so devoted they would stand here  
door open, hands at their sides  
waiting for a miracle  
but maybe miracles don’t exist  
outside of fairy tales.
