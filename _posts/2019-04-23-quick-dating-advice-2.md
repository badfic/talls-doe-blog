If you are a <del>murderer or serial killer</del> someone using an online dating app such as Tumblr or Bumble, be sure to use a picture of an adorable animal to entice your pre-ahem-future mate.

You should avoid, if at all possible, using any of the following picture formats as it does not attract potential vict-ahem-mates, and they *will* swipe left. Do not use obnoxious angles, pictures that are not representative of your true self, close up pictures, or blurry photographs.

All photographs should be in high resolution and taken by Beyonceâ€™s personal photographer. All images must be unique and organic. Do not copy them from the internet. Spare no expense.
