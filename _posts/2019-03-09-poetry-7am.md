You left at 5:30  
and here I am sitting up  
so sick I can’t even function  
but my heart is so  
broken &amp; lonely without you  
and I still don’t understand  
why there isn’t anyone else I’d rather be with  
when most nights all I do  
is stay awake  
staring at a computer screen  
and wishing you wouldn’t leave.
