“Your eyes are the *stars* and they  
***S P A R K L E*** ;   
full of life.  
  
Even with the clouds they manage  
to shine brightly, overtaking  
  
I’ve *never* seen eyes more  
B E A U T I F U L  
than yours are.”  
  
The words

> as   
>  they  
>  fall

have never been so beautiful  
than when they escaped your lips.

And you tell me in promises of  
“F O R E V E R”  
that you’ll love me.
