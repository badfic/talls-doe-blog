There is no escape from mediocrity   
Look around, see the world for what it is  
It’s eroded, broken, filled with doubt  
Yet, there is always someone there  
in the distance, smiling  
But, in the end it’s empty; Absolute.  
*nothingness*.

Look! Look and see  
Time it ebbs and it flows  
And history is just a repeat of a repeat of a repeat  
Regardless of knowledge, regardless of intellect   
The pattern goes, *goes*, ***goes***  
*forever*.  
  
It’s never-ending,  
***time***   
Is a never-ending thing  
but you  
Are not infinite  
In ignorance, this is an absolute  
forgotten  
By the passage of time  
Where we believe ourselves immortal  
immune  
 &amp;  
unbreakable.  
  
But *see*  
We; you &amp; me, are nothing more than  
specks   
Us; we, are less than insignificant  
less than nothing.  
  
There are no marks,   
No legacies left  
 to leave behind   
And **yet**  
Life continues on  
Its ignorance unopposed  
And there are people *still* glad,  
Still *happy* every single day to be   
What **they** consider:  
 alive.  
  
Are they; them &amp; I living the same life  
Are we part of the same existence?  
Because all life does to me  
Is it makes me feel as though I have *failed*  
That, instead of being unborn,   
Instead of being *nothing*  
I have been made to live  
 &amp; suffer  
a life of *mediocrity*  
  
I am not resigned to pretending  
That there is something *more* than this  
More than looking up and realizing  
One day I will die  
and leave behind *nothing*.  
No matter how much I live  
No matter how much time I am allotted   
by life, by god, by powers beyond comprehension  
***I***; me &amp; myself  
Am no more, than insignificant.
