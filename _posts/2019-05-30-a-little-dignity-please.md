Dear Heart,  
Fools who run in, burn out  
like stars and life and fires and cars  
eventually the last light snuffs  
the last thread breaks  
the last breath breathed  
but even though nothing truly lasts  
things always begin anew.  
  
So break, dear friend and mend again  
become strong and stand alone  
be proof of strength and honor and glory  
of love and patience and understanding  
proof that all things become new.  
  
Be wary friend, of all that glue  
and be patient as you wait  
and always remember, my dear friend  
slow and steady wins the race
