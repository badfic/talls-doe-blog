### NSFW Warning

There are no words to describe how I feel in the wake of posting this. So many new fans have risen from the ashes to yell at us for not posting the next part of this debauchery.

I’m Des, that’s <a>13</a> and this is Jack Ass.

**Thirteen:** ??  
**Me:** Because I’m bout to fuck your shit up, nerd.  
**Thirteen:** Oh noOOOO IT’S THAT TIME AGAIN   
**Me**: Where do we go?  
**Thirteen:** Jesus. Nowhere is good.  
**Thirteen:**  Like what could possibly even happen in the bathroom?  
**Thirteen:** That we want to see   
**Thirteen:** We know the bedroom is basically Ground Zero and we’ve exhausted the couch. So to speak.   
**Thirteen:** Like what would a good, non-creepy dad do? NONE OF THESE THINGS.  
**Me:**  I mean maybe Lolita has to pee?   
**Thirteen:** Why do we need to be there for it though. (Fuckin. Was watersports on the kink list? …did I ask that? I feel like I did.)   
**Me:** Or poop? She did eat a lot of pizza. (You did, and it is not).  
**Thirteen:** so much she cOULDN’T TAKE IT ANYMORE AHAHAHA   
**Thirteen:** Okay well. I guess it’s…slightly…less terrifying…than Ground Zero.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/2e9e5dbbcb5fb79a1620c3ce2bf751a4/tumblr_inline_ov4kqchVTq1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** We’ve somehow ended up back on the couch. Even though I chose bathroom.   
**Thirteen:** Ugh. It IS getting creepy how they keep insistently referring to it as a date.   
**Thirteen:** Like I talk with my mom about making plans for a date so we can go hit up thrift stores and shit but like. We only say that like, once.   
**Me:** I feel like this is more acceptable between you and your mom since you know…you’ve seen each other like almost every day since your birth.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/d98535a807bf21d29634b0c3cafec5af/tumblr_inline_ov4kvntIH11qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Lolita:** Or thirty. Please tell me you have matches?  
**Thirteen**: Or, forever. Just stay there. We’ll leave. You can keep the dildo pile.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/7d0f82349a9e82db60fad36f764f559f/tumblr_inline_ov4kyg1bJI1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** WHAT IS THAT HAND DOING?   
**Thirteen:** Nothing natural or human.  
**Me:** PLEASE TELL ME HE’S NOT GOING TO TAKE HER HAND AND LEAD HER TO THE BATHROOM.  
**Thirteen**: Can’t you just say “oh yeah, right down the hall, first door you see” or something?   
**Thirteen:** THIS DOES NOT NEED TO BE A GROUP EVENT.  
**Thirteen:** I know it’s basic politeness and literally everyone does that but it sort of makes me snort every time someone asks if they may use the bathroom.   
**Thirteen:** Like someone’s going to go “NO YOU MAY NOT PISS ON THESE PREMISES”   
**Me:**  CUSTOMERS ONLY.  
**Thirteen:** Especially in a situation like this where they’re FAMILY (which cannot be overemphasized) and in one of their homes.   
**Thirteen:** Like, you’d ASSUME yes, your family will allow you that much, sheesh.  
**Me:** OH HE MOST CERTAINLY WILL.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/830c94d1e0a81e2aa098f297cc7d8e87/tumblr_inline_ov4l5ijMm91qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Thirteen:** Oh, good.  
**Thirteen:** Also shit girl  
**Thirteen:** How fucking long is that fucking hair  
**Thirteen:** It’s like ass-length, AND pulled up nearly on top of her head   
**Me:** It’s 5’6 but she’s only 5’3   
**Thirteen:** LOL  
**Thirteen:** I like that “mmm”. Like she’s carefully contemplating the bathroom.   
**Thirteen:** “mm yes, solid structure, continuing the all-white theme (seriously even the TOWELS are white fucking hell, COLOR IS A THING), hideous fake-marble slab floor…”   
**Thirteen:** “all in all, a solid 3/10”

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/bf29a7ebbbb9ccdfbc7c0c51cabc6628/tumblr_inline_ov4lawnuY31qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** …  
**Thirteen:** …you apparently intend to watch while she pisses, maybe?   
**Me:** Or maybe the shower is to small to fuck in?   
**Thirteen:** I dunno, she’s pretty tiny. Though her tits will take up half of it.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/d5a05d0bdeddbb9c7d4c9b4b1e6841b9/tumblr_inline_ov4lezUW5Z1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** As soon as I clicked next  
**Me:** Santiago said “What the fuck”  
**Me:** And it was completely unrelated to this, but still somehow exactly how I feel.  
**Thirteen:** …..why does he not have a door to his bathroom

### *w h y*

**Thirteen:** Are we SURE there weren’t any bathroom-related kinks on the list because…  
**Thirteen:** Also…how fucking stupid is Humbert that it doesn’t occur to him that the lack of a door MIGHT be an issue  
**Me:** I mean he thinks his Italian neighbor Paolo is a pizza delivery guy  
**Thirteen:** Okay, fair  
**Thirteen:** So I guess we can just assume he pisses in front of everyone all the time and thinks that and the clapping spectators is totally normal.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/42ff9a39dc9ae106d553f95e879e4540/tumblr_inline_ov4lnngNgo1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>### **Humbert: \*sweats\* bathrooms don’t come with doors, sweetie. That is simply not how things are done.**

**Thirteen:** Humbert may or may not be an alien   
**Thirteen:** Or he’s simply a filthy degenerate pervert, and we know which one it is.  
**Thirteen:** The awkward-ass pose of her legs is bugging the shit out of me.  
**Thirteen:** And I’m assuming this den of horrors is tiny as hell but man, that speaker there keeps cracking me up since it’s in such close proximity to the mysterious doorless bathroom.  
**Thirteen:** I think his entire home is the size of my bedroom. Or my snake’s terrarium.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/4443c869b4bb6d75ddd94dce7068fd57/tumblr_inline_ov4lswQss11qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** FFFUFUFUCK SHE TURNED AROUND REAL QUICK.  
**Thirteen**: I imagine her just whirling around like a spinning top with a “fWIP” sound   
**Me:** THAT’S BASICALLY HOW IT HAPPENED.   
**Me:** PRETTY SURE I EVEN SAW HER TITS WOBBLE.   
**Thirteen:** I was just going to ask how she kept her balance with her giant fuckin tiddies because her ass is NOT big enough to counterbalance that much silicon.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/0c6532a27a23a99f13685ea26700e1d9/tumblr_inline_ov4lxvLNFy1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** NO SHIT. WHAT HAPPENED TO IT, HUMBERT?   
**Thirteen:** Did it get broke in one of your disgusting sex parties or did you remove it to make said sex parties easier? Haha just kidding, you’re way too much of a moron to have sex parties. And not nearly smart enough to lure that many ten-year-olds home.   
**Me:** EXPLAIN YOURSELF YOU CREEPY OLD MAN.

### **Blah blah blah this whole bathroom door shit continues on and on about how Lolita is just like “How can you live like this” and Humbert is like “I haven’t been laid in years” (not really, but stars and storms we were all thinking it). He really only said the rent was cheap and there was a nice shower. Leading to Lolita asking the hard hitting questions:**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/e6a864ebd19f113432b3cc8dd64df11d/tumblr_inline_ov4m3u2vkA1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>### Humbert: Well honey, obviously I’d just leer at her while she pees. What ELSE would I do?

**Thirteen:** Seriously, though. I cannot believe there is not some kind of fetish associated with this. Why the fuck else would his bathroom inexplicably have no door?   
**Thirteen:** If that’s NOT a kink thing, it is just so bizarrely RANDOM.   
**Thirteen:** PS: what if you dad is gay, Lolita? WHAT THEN?  
**Thirteen:** (then he’d be in a better game with a better daughter and be hitting on other gay dads, that’s what).  
**Me:** (Preferably gothic gay dads).

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/11fb7f6160b2b980271eb41b39af792e/tumblr_inline_ov4m9jeEAs1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** \*SLAPS SELF IN THE FACE\*   
**Thirteen:** Humbert   
**Thirteen:** Why   
**Thirteen:** Would you even think that   
**Thirteen:** She clearly meant a ~GIRL~ girl, like “a girl I want to impress and preferably fuck”.Why is your first thought your *daughter*.   
**Thirteen:** (I know why, because you’re disgusting, but humor me.)

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/cf6adf995e27e73643b4ab2552569897/tumblr_inline_ov4mdm2D3N1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** \*TRIES TO CLIMB OUT OF THE WINDOW\*  
**Thirteen:** Yeah you’d like him to be thinking about you wouldn’t you you atrocious trollop?  
**Me:** She’s trying to be smooth. Trying to find out if he’s seeing anybody.  
**Me:** I see right through you, Lolita.  
**Me:** Oldest trick in the book.  
**Thirteen:** I guess just asking if he’s seeing anybody outright (like, say, when she mentioned her mom has a boyfriend) wouldn’t be creepy enough. Gotta subtly hit on him so he doesn’t think she’s just interested in his life.   
**Thirteen:** And man, they have not talked about themselves at ALL for a long-estranged parent-child pair.   
**Thirteen:** I know it’s because they have no personality except “revolting” but still.   
**Me:** \*sighs wistfully\* If this were Amanda and Alphonse they would have already started making bacon and she’d be telling him all about her classes at college and Lucien would be there making veggie bacon and Damien would be braiding her hair. And everything would be good and just in the world.   
**Thirteen:** And it would be The Cutest Thing.   
**Me:** AND THEY WOULD HAVE DOORS ON THE BATHROOMS.   
**Thirteen:** WHAT A FUCKING CONCEPT.  
**Thirteen:** Shit Damien probably has like, six bathrooms in his beautiful-ass goth mansion   
**Me:** \*Swoons over Damien briefly before returning to the train wreck that is my life\*  
**Thirteen:** Right. Yes. This. -mournful sigh-

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/8d7eae28ae17590d59bd0e12593a6850/tumblr_inline_ov4mq9JKZT1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>### **Humbert:** But I’ll be listening…*waiting*.

**Thirteen:**  Well you would  
**Thirteen:** *If you had one*  
**Thirteen:** I feel like “there’s not a fucking door” should have been mentioned when she asked to use the bathroom in the first place, by the way. Not that you’d know, Humbert, since nobody ever visits you.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/549eb20aaa0ff6d8f8424c4e9e157a74/tumblr_inline_ov4mvdJ8Ap1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Thirteen**: …  
**Thirteen:** Lolita, stop agreeing with me, you shameless tramp.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/0dc3d56b99076bc66d4d844d57dc293e/tumblr_inline_ov4mypxcvd1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** I feel like this isn’t something you should have to say to your father? Like maybe it should be obvious to absolutely *everyone* that he wouldn’t peek? Just saying??????   
**Thirteen:** Jesus, okay, look. I, admittedly, have a bladder of iron, but I fucking promise you I would be entirely capable of not peeing around someone who I was worried might fucking peek on me.  
**Thirteen:** Because that is fucking vile.  
**Thirteen:** Lolita you little cockwomble, you are absolutely into this. Stop playing coy.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/c9b6d63b54d91a50710cc666b349b0e1/tumblr_inline_ov4n54X9w81qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** Jump out of a nearby window   
**Me:** run out into traffic   
**Me:** eat glass   
**Thirteen:** All of the above is also a choice for extra credit.  
**Me:** Call Paolo a guido until he beats the shit out of you.   
**Thirteen:** I mean at least if he does that then his creepy slut daughter will be hitting up some guy she isn’t fucking related to.  
**Me:** I don’t know man, maybe watching her father get beaten up by fake delivery drivers who deliver Italian-style frozen pizza to her door is like her kink or something.   
**Thirteen:** I mean, I’m assuming Paolo would at least put him out of commission if not kill him   
**Thirteen:** So she’d have to jump him for lack of other options (with functional lungs)   
**Me:** Necrophelia?   
**Thirteen:** …  
**Thirteen:** Well, that is a fair risk to consider.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/f181c93f088fa36a1f0bd505e708b334/tumblr_inline_ov4ndaqpIM1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** \*THROWS HANDS UP IN THE AIR\*  
**Thirteen:** WHY IS THIS A CHOICE?  
**Thirteen:** Jesus this game makes me feel like I need to go to church and I am *literally a Satanist*  
**Thirteen:** And nothing has happened yet.  
**Me:** OBVIOUSLY DON’T PEEK, HUMBERT. I DON’T EVEN KNOW WHY YOU NEED ME TO BE YOUR CONSCIENCE FOR WHATEVER REASON.   
**Thirteen:** I feel like we’re the two halves of his conscience (both of us are “good” because lbr you can’t get much worse) shrieking into the void that is his skull and trying desperately to avoid absolute disaster.  
**Me:** And ultimately failing.   
**Thirteen:** The hell of it is that we know it’s futile but we still have to try.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/83f515ae06760112c1472a1ef7ff86f7/tumblr_inline_ov4nm7fMSS1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>### **Lolita:** No *dad –* IF THAT EVEN IS YOUR REAL NAME *–*everything is definitely **not** okay. Now that I don’t have to pee so bad I can’t think straight, let’s go to fucking LOWE’S AND GET A FUCKING DOOR.

**Thirteen:**  Shit at this rate I’d accept a piece of plywood awkwardly leaned against the wall.  
**Thirteen:**Also, what the fuck?   
**Thirteen:** Was he expecting her to share details of how delightful her piss was or was not?   
**Thirteen:** Who asks that   
**Thirteen:** (Except a creepy weirdo getting a boner about girls peeing).

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/5a1056f9135412e33fb16f2f3cd8943d/tumblr_inline_ov4nsaaAHq1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** IT DOESN’T HAVE A DOOR, LOLITA.

### **Lolita:** Except for the lack of door. And hideous floor. And blindingly white color scheme. And generally being smaller than a closet. Also, the six cameras I found hidden in there. Besides that, it’s great.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/ee94901fee945155c5cbef74f8d37394/tumblr_inline_ov4nuyv92d1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** -\_-. They’re gonna have shower sex aren’t they?   
**Thirteen:** I’m still convinced her tits will take up half or more of the shower, so does it count if one of them isn’t technically IN the shower?   
**Me:** If Bill Clinton has taught me anything. It’s that, if it isn’t all the way it ain’t sex.

### Blah blah blah. Semantics. Bullshit. Dumb shitty boring dialogue. Lolita suggests they continue their date. I question my sanity. Thirteen questions if she ever cared about me at all. We’re still somehow on day one. This is some sort of alternate universe where days last 172 hours and not having doors is trendy.

**Thirteen:** Also, white is the BEST color for everything! Except floors. Those come in “ugly blond wood” or “fake-ass marble”.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/b61d278e34afcf6e7e55d051d8d0ecc3/tumblr_inline_ov4o35Wsv81qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** There’s only one option left.  
**Thirteen:** Die?   
**Thirteen:** I will also accept “murder-suicide”.   
**Thirteen:** You can decide if I mean in-game or out.   
**Me:** I’m too far away to murder you. And yes, I would still say that even if I was sitting right next to you.   
**Thirteen:** Shit. Welp.   
**Thirteen:** Ground Zero it is, then.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/0986f5d4d915b1835b6dda6497de8089/tumblr_inline_ov4o7yjeoo1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** did…did her boobs get **bigger**?   
**Thirteen:** Shit, I dunno, probably. I’m too mesmerized by her weird hair which is both floating and sitting at a weird angle.   
**Thirteen:** And like. Literally nobody talks like this.   
**Thirteen:** I’ve never had anyone ask me that when they see my room.   
**Thirteen:** But mostly they coo over how cool it is because I have a personality, unlike Humbert.   
**Me:** Unless you’re me and you immediately demand to hold a snake and also where the cat is.   
**Thirteen:** Nah, that’s pretty common too actually.   
**Thirteen:** It basically falls into gushing over the skulls, or asking what lives in the terrariums and maybe if they’re friendly enough to be held.   
**Me:** I knew I should have asked “So this is where you sleep huh??” Then suggestive eyebrow waggle and laid down on your bed with a rose between my teeth.   
**Thirteen:** That’s what you get for not planning ahead.   
**Thirteen:** Is Lolita going to ask next if he does anything…else…there while “coincidentally” squishing her tits together?

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/79712e76a747930b7ed787fc88fbd0d5/tumblr_inline_ov4oibGdL61qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** No, but this is just as bad.

### Humbert: Want to…try it out?

**Thirteen:** I like him better when he’s being a fucking moron.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/5dc84473ecb03a92bc758a20407f05c3/tumblr_inline_ov4olmsboM1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>### Lolita: By “it” I mean your dick. And by “jump” I mean insert into my vagina.

**Thirteen:** That, or she’s back to being twelve (or, well, younger) again.  
**Thirteen:** Anyway sure go on I’m sure Humbert would love to watch you black your eyes with your tits.   
**Me:** A new kind of fetish.   
**Thirteen:** I mean, I’d like to watch stupid twats beat themselves up but I don’t get off on it so I guess that doesn’t count.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/f38832c9e3ad8e45ffb897da3ef89dd2/tumblr_inline_ov4opan75B1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>### Humbert: What are you? Twel-OH

**Thirteen:** I guaran-damn-tee you do not have ANY interest in jumping or running or any other bouncy movement until you strap your gazongas down, girl.  
**Thirteen:** And if you did you’d get over it REAL QUICK  
**Thirteen:** And I know beating on the shit dialogue is basically a dead, buried, rotted, and exhumed horse at this point but who immediately (or ever) asks to jump on someone’s bed  
**Thirteen:** Who?

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/5cc28678671e133bb3c0c40c3351e47b/tumblr_inline_ov4ov2yeXd1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>Me:   
Humbert:   
Me:   
Humbert:   
Me: \*DRAWS SWORD\* ***THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE!* Thirteen:** He’s just trying to clarify to figure out if she’s young enough for him (I mean I’d be surprised if he knew his own daughter’s age tbh)  
**Thirteen:** (Intro text be damned)

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/d0c82bfc749542a8ba95191416665e6d/tumblr_inline_ov4oyiUlwW1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** I read that as “You say *you’re* good in bed” and I was like “Fuck did the game glitch? Is this what happens when you peek on her peeing?”   
**Thirteen:** I really do not need to have Humbert pop a boner over Lolita’s bouncing titties, game. Please stop this.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/2b088932fea7a0c608501de884139ef3/tumblr_inline_ov4p1tcIEs1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** I say we let her jump. Maybe she’ll knock herself out with those giant tits.   
**Thirteen:** Man, I’m leaning no just because fuck you, hussy, you may NOT jump on the bed like a fucktard. What if your 100-lb ass breaks it? She likes us too much anyway.   
**Me:** But what if discipline is her thing?   
**Thirteen:** Yeah, but like, isn’t it worth it just ot not let her get her way for once? Then we can pointedly not punish her later.  
**Thirteen:** Also, she’s gross and I hate her.   
**Me:** Alright. No Lolitas jumpin on the bed.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/41a2615719229cd5afc4ebd52dee23f4/tumblr_inline_ov4pa0iQYl1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** She got so mad she dislocated her jaw.  
**Thirteen:** Because it’s stupid and you’re stupid.

**Me:** Yes.  
**Thirteen:** Yes.  
**Thirteen:** Absolutely.  
**Thirteen:** We are in agreement, you’ve been voted off the island. Before your fat, fat ass sinks it.

### In-game Humbert says no. Lolita goes back to her self-absorbed begging. “Lemme jump. Daddy lemme jump.” She will not take no for an answer. 

### OH WAIT. SHIT WE HAVE ONE LESS GREEN POINT. YES! WE DID SOMETHING RIGHT!

**Thirteen:** -FISTPUMP- WOOOO  
**Thirteen:** My instincts were correct!

### Humbert still fucking lets her jump on the bed. I guess this was going to happen whether we wanted it to or not. 

**Thirteen:** Well yes. Gotta watch them fake-ass tiddies bounce.   
**Thirteen:** Why doesn’t she have her OWN bed to jump on? Or does she actually live in a cardboard box?

Thirteen: Man her proportions are hilarious. How does she not topple over like, constantly?   
**Thirteen:** And what is that? A blank mint-green canvas?  
**Thirteen:** Is that your attempt at decorating, Humbert?   
**Me:** Modern art some hipster in a coffee shop sold him because he said it would make him seem intelligent.   
**Thirteen:** Except he probably said it in a way so that Humbert only understood like 25% of the words because he’s as thick as pig shit.   
**Thirteen:** Anyway hurry up and break your spine you stupid child so we can kick your gross ass out.

**Thirteen:** Well, if snakes could use doors, anyway.

Thirteen: We know you’re a kid on account of the fact that you’re like twelve, Lolita. This is not news.   
**Me:** It’s VIRGIN airline’s newest addition. Sexbot plane 3.0.   
**Thirteen:** Virgin my ass.   
**Thirteen:** Hell, my ass is a metric fuckload more virginal than this thing is.   
**Me:** *MY* ass is probably a metric fuckload more virginal that that thing is.   
**Thirteen:** I wish I knew a slutty gay dude to claim HIS ass was more virginal, but alas.   
**Me:** I know several, but none I can call out tag on Tumblr :P.

**Thirteen:** They might BE hot dogs.

**Thirteen:** Clearly Humbert is moving in for the kill   
**Thirteen:** I like how the railing looks alarmingly like a baby crib   
**Thirteen:** Also, cameo from the dildo pile   
**Me:** It’s subliminal messaging. The game wants us to know on some level she’s nowhere near 18.   
**Thirteen:** I knew that the second it said she was eighteen   
**Thirteen:** Also, nice “smell my armpit” pose.

**Me:** I love how *I* have to click it too. It’s like the game is reminding me “HEY YOU. YOU ASKED FOR THIS. PICK UP THE PILLOW AND FROLIC LIKE THE DISGUSTING OLD MAN YOU ARE”.   
**Thirteen:** Why can’t we be a stuffy old coot? This game is ruining ~MY IMMERSION~.

**Me:** Oho. you’re *flexible* hm? (fuck what have I become?)  
**Thirteen:** Now now, don’t try to distract me with flirting. You started this and by the gods we’re going to finish it.   
**Me:** We’re not even past day one. We’re going to die here.

**Thirteen:** And I feel like, if you could write worth a damn, something like “what are you–DO NOT” would make more sense and not make her seem like a bumblefuck

### Humbert: You can stay the night… -zip- …if you want… -waggles dick at her-

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/c62ae2f1e991d9fd3f5d1ecd50b2a4bd/tumblr_inline_ov4u9xRReY1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>### Humbert: WELL FUCK GUESS I GOTTA GET OFF THE SOFA. \*DICK STILL IN HAND\* EYY BB U WAN DIS DICK?

**Thirteen:** I am unusually terrified what getting off the sofa means…

**Me:** and they’re exclusive.   
**Thirteen:** Hell, I’m just hoping she’s not *related* to Elena.

### Elena left 15 messages, Lolita is holding her phone weird. The screen goes black. It’s still day one. My life is a lie. How can a day be this long. Holy fuck. 

**Thirteen:** oh my goooddddsssss.

**Thirteen:** Your super-creepy pedo dad who you’re trying to seduce

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/d693693cde8f2c196d7d0f43209e8243/tumblr_inline_ov4uk7Fdke1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** Elena seems like she’s got a good head on her shoulders. Lolita! **be Elena**.  
**Thirteen:** No fucking shit, sweetcheeks. You took after dad there. (By which I mean you’re a fuckwit.)   
**Thirteen:** Why is Elena in this? She seems too normal and not-moronic.   
**Me:** They’re probably gonna kill her.

**Thirteen:** Yep guess you have time to fuck off forever okay bye? BYE!

### Lolita: …but it was also, like, super creepy, so let’s never talk again, okay?

**Thirteen:** Oh wait wait wait I think I figured out the Elena thing. She was Lolita’s backup plan to get out quick if things got creepy, but then Lolita never contacted her at their agreed-time to confirm she was okay. You girls are about as organized as a senior citizen orgy.

**Thirteen:** ALRIGHT WELP BYE THEN!

### Lolita says she’ll call Humbert sometime this week to set up another date. Again with that terrible godforsaken word. And he, being the pathetic pedophile he is, eagerly awaits her call. Then this:

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/fe9540bb6b02e5e123c69d71a031f9af/tumblr_inline_ov4v73O2XA1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me**:NO

**Thirteen:** I’m concerned with why that handle is so high considering Humbert is like eight feet tall or something.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/e955e4b58067439b6116f8a72736e79d/tumblr_inline_ov4vciqWBa1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** OH **FFFFFFFFFUUUUCCCKCKKK NOOOOOO**!!

**Me:** I don’t know man, I lost the ability to see 9 years ago.   
**Thirteen:** I mean they probably are since it’s 5 FUCKING AM

### Blah blah blah a total repeat of the phone conversation. Elena was worried was gonna call the police or some shit. There’s a PARTY????? FUCK NO ELENA SHUT THAT SHIT DOWN. ABORT. ABORT. DO YOU HEAR ME YOU GIANT VAGINA????

**Thirteen:** ugh I am nOT FUCKING PREPARED FOR THIS OKAY?  
**Thirteen:** FUCK THIS. I AM STOPPING THIS ON ACCOUNT OF NEEDING TO SLEEP BECAUSE I AM ACTUALLY DOING SHIT TODAY  
**Thirteen:** FUCK YOU LOLITA!  
**Me:** I FUCKING GIVE UP. IT’S DAY TWO. THERE’S NO DAY COUNTER.

**Me**: GOOD NIGHT.
