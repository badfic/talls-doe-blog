Perfection

Summary:*Edward leaves Bella in search of something a little more real. BellaxEdward, Edwardx?, Hints at JacobxRenesmee*

Notes:*The answer to your question is no, darling. I am not a Twilight fan.*

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

He loved her with all that he was and she loved him, but if love had taught them anything…it isn’t always enough. They stood in the woods, *their* woods face to face. Her eyes were brimming with bloody tears, his own eyes dry as he gazed down at her.

“I changed everything for you,” she sobbed, “I gave up who I was…for *you*” He knew this was true, she had married him, she had changed into a vampire for him, and she had almost lost her life to give him his daughter. Bella had done so much for him it was almost disgusting.

“I know,” he told her, “I’m sorry.” It was all he had to offer, a simple apology. He couldn’t put up with her anymore. Not her whining, her paranoia, her constant presence was sending him over the edge.

“I thought you *loved me*,” she hissed, bloody tears pouring down her face as she sobbed wildly, hands clutching at the fabric of her shirt. He watched as it ripped like paper in her hands.

“I do,” he whispered, “Bella, I *do* love you.” It was the truth, he loved her with all of his heart, all of his soul…but he wasn’t sure if they would last. They were too different, she was too clingy, too whiny, too jealous. He was too logical, too distant.

“Then why are you *doing* this?” She screamed, grabbing at her shirt again. He watched as the rest of the fabric tore, falling to her feet in tiny shreds. He sighed, eyes falling on her perfect body. She had supple breasts with a flat stomach and a graceful neck. Her arms and legs were both thin yet muscular. In essence, Bella was beautiful, heck even her name suggested beauty. But Edward had had enough of all this perfection. He wanted something real, something alive, breathing. He *needed* something human.

“Sometimes love isn’t enough,” he responded, sparing her the details of exactly why he didn’t want to be with her anymore. She was simply, too perfect for him.

“What about our daughter?” She asked desperately, “Don’t you care about her?”

“Of course I care about Renesmee,” he told her, inwardly wincing at how stupid the name Bella had chosen for their daughter really was. He wished she had just named her Carlie at least that was easy to spell.

“Why are you doing this?” She asked again and Edward sighed, choosing not to answer this time. He turned away from her and sprinted away. Bella stared after him, a gust of wind blowing her hair into her face. Her mouth hung open in surprise, stone cold hands trembling on either side of her. She could feel the familiar ache in her chest, a hole where her already non-existent heart used to be.

Edward had left her again.
