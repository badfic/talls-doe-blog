I write about the sandman  
and I tell you “It’s a true story”  
the hole that “leads to neverland”  
is really…  
in my back yard  
and is, the size of my fist  
and it could  
p  
 u  
 l  
 l  
you through it just as easily as it was dug.

I write about the deep blue ocean  
and I tell you “It’s dark, crushing me”  
the ocean is suffocating and  
it’s where I   
re  
si  
de  
when you’re not with me.

I write about my bruise kissed eyes  
and I tell you “I can’t imagine sleeping”  
not without you, your breath against my ear  
and the smell of cinnamon and strawberries  
I  
tell   
you  
“the white noise” is what helps me sleep  
but really, it’s the certainty of knowing   
you can be so close that I can   
(almost) feel you.

I write about the dreams I have about you  
and I tell you “I can feel you sometimes”  
but I feel you every night, I can imagine your skin  
your hair, fingertips, light touches as you trace my body  
do   
you  
even  
know?  
The question is simple, stupid even  
I can   
f e e l you.

I write about you, mostly  
and I tell you “I love you”  
and sometimes you question the truthfulness   
and it hurts, but I question you too  
in   
*s i l e n c e*  
and I try hard not to make it known.

I write about how you break my heart  
and I tell you nothing and let you believe in the hurt  
but you could never break me

you.  
 keep.  
 me.  
 complete.
