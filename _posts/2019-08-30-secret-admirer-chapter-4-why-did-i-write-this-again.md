Secret Admirer

Disclaimer:*You tired of this yet? I don’t own JONAS.*

Author’s Notes:*Sunset Clouds threatened to kill me if I didn’t update. I know you’re all dying from suspense!*

. . . . . . . .

Kevin swallowed hard and stared down at Stella. She had a look on her face that reminded him of his mom’s “clean out the tour bus and do all your dirty laundry” look. This was serious.

“I-I,” Kevin sputtered. The finger Stella had pressed into his chest was making him nervous. Even more nervous when she pressed harder. “I didn’t write the notes!” He blurted. Stella glared at him.

“Don’t lie to me, Kevin,” she said, her tone serious.

“I’m not,” he said, sweat beading on his forehead as he repeated, “I didn’t write the notes.”

“What about the rose?” She asked, “did you put the rose on her locker?” Kevin stared at Stella’s finger, almost whimpering. She was pressing so hard now, he was sure it was going to bruise.

“N-” he coughed, trying to maintain his even voice, “No?” He said, voice high-pitched.

“Ah-ha!” Stella said, removing her finger, and turning around to pace, smirking, “So you*are* her secret admirer!” Kevin sighed.

“No,” he said, “Joe told me to put the rose on her locker.” Stella stopped and whirled around to face him. She brought her hand back up and pointed. Kevin winced, hoping silently that she didn’t jab him in the chest again.

“You mean to tell me,” Stella said, her voice almost shrill as she got closer, “that *Joe*, is Macy’s secret admirer?”

“Not, really,” Kevin said, “I mean, Nick wrote the notes…” Stella screamed in frustration, stomping her foot.

“Then which one of you likes her?” Stella asked, throwing her hands up in the air. Kevin winced again. Stella tapped her foot impatiently, crossing her arms.

“I,” Kevin said, his voice high-pitched, “I…I don’t know!”

“You do too,” Stella said, trying now to calm down, “your voice is all squeaky and panicked, now *tell me*.” She poked her finger into his chest again. “Why in the world are all three of you writing her notes anyway?” Stella paused, realization washing over her face. She gasped, dropping her hand back to her side. She stared at Kevin, mouth agape. “Are you playing a *joke* on my best friend?” She asked, her voice shrill.

“No! No!” Kevin said frantically, “I just…Joe and Nick…and…I got caught up in this…and…I don’t know!” Stella put a hand on her hip and stared at him.

“Whose idea was this?” Stella asked, but just as Kevin opened his mouth, she stopped him by holding up her hand, “Nevermind. I know whose idea this was-Joe’s right?” Kevin flashed a nervous smile.

“Just *wait*until I get my hands on him,” she growled, making neck wringing motions with her hands, “And *Nick*,” she growled before continuing, “but first, *you*.” Kevin gulped. “What’s this whole thing about, Kev?” Kevin was on the verge of hyperventilating.

“I really like Macy and Joe and Nick were trying to prove that even though I kept denying it, so they came up with a stupid plan to write notes and try to make me jealous about this whole secret admirer thing, but I found out what they were doing so they made me put the rose there, but the rose had thorns, so I ended up getting pricked a-“

“Wait!” Stella yelled, “You really like Macy?” Kevin nodded. “And your brothers were just being idiots?” Kevin nodded again. Stella put her hand over her heart and took a deep breath, “Oh, good,” she said, “I was beginning to think that this might be another Maria catastrophe.” She laughed, looking up at Kevin. “Now, tell me,” she said, “Why didn’t you*stop*them?”

“Because,” Kevin said, a lot calmer than the previous time he had spoken, “They were going to give her one last note, one that I wrote myself, and then have me reveal myself as her admirer. That way, Macy never knew what they were trying to pull off, and I got to do something sweet for her.” Stella couldn’t help but awh at that.

“That’s so sweet,” she said, “even if your brothers are idiots, this turned out to be a really good idea.” Kevin smiled. “I want in on it.” He smiled wider.

“This is going to be awesome,” he said, putting his arm around Stella.

“Totally,” she said, with a huge grin, “I have to make you the *perfect* outfit…oh, oh, and a dress for Macy…” Kevin laughed.

“Don’t get too carried away, Stells,” he said, “We still have to plant the last note. Just, no more roses,” he held up his hand, “I can’t take anymore thorns.” Stella arched her eyebrow.

“You do know they have thornless roses, right, Kev?” She asked.

“That would’ve been really helpful to know the *first* time.”
