Here is your periodic reminder that I use Amazon Referral links on my site. So any of the book links you click, whether they’re mine or someone elses, are referral links.

This is helpful to boost my site SEO, find new readers, and also be useful in the eyes of Amazon.

When I move my blog in the next month to my actual site domain, there will be a dedicated little blurb at the bottom of the page stating this so I won’t have to do a blog every now and then about it, but until then this is how we do it.

Mainly because WordPress.com charges like $500 a year for custom CSS/Widgets. It’s total bullshit.

But I use referral links! So if you buy stuff I get like 10 cents in my Amazon Associates account. But it’ll probably get taken because of fees or something.
