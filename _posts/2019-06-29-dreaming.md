Is this a *dream*?  
I’ve oft asked myself that question  
but the pinches don’t wake me up  
and my whole world is **:**  
s p i n n i n g  
around and around and around.

I had defined love’s taste as **bitter**  
but now it tastes *sweet* on my tongue  
it’s slow like syrup **&amp;** warm like grace.
