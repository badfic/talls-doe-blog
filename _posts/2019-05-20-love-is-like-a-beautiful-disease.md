you take the breath from my lungs &amp;  
force me on my knees, body shaking  
with longing and fear of open doors.

you push me back and watch me  
gently fall to the floor like flower petals  
and I stare at you, parted lips  
and an open heart; waiting for sin.

you whisper “you’re so beautiful”  
caressing me with the flesh of your lips  
against my ear and I can’t breathe  
you’re so close to me.

my body is like lightning beneath you  
hot, static, dynamic, *amazing*  
and you’re body is the rain  
putting out the fire we’ve ignited  
deep within our own desires.

my heart is splitting open and pounding  
as your hand cups my face and I can feel  
my veins course with fire beneath your fingers  
i can’t even think, all my thoughts on you.

and for a moment  
we’re the only two people  
left on this planet.
