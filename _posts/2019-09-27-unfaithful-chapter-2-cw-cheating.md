So this story is totally addicting. I know, I’m so arrogant. Homfg. Anyways, before I start let me just say like two things.

First, for step by step updates on my awesome life follow me on twitter at imbrication! Please D:? and forgive me if this is a little weird.

I’m so pushing for a shower scene.

Unfaithful  
Chapter Two  
Back In

BEGIN &amp;&amp;

Macy wasn’t sure why she couldn’t just be happy with Kevin. He was sweet, caring, and the best boyfriend she could ever ask for. But he was *also* against many of the things she craved. His younger brother, however, would give her anything she wanted. He would quench her thirst for certain *sensations*.

“Kevin?” She called into the boy’s bedroom at the Lucas’ house. The eldest Lucas brother had texted her ten minutes prior, asking her to come over. However, she had yet to find him. In fact, she had yet to find anyone other than Sandy, the boys’ mother who had let her in. But she doubted their mother even really saw her, she had been on the phone, talking rapidly while flipping through a cookbook and a magazine.

She called his name again, pushing open the door to the bathroom that the boys shared.

The door had been left slightly ajar, but even so, she still found herself closing her eyes as she made her way into the room. She felt the moist sensation of steam hitting her face and she opened her eyes, confused.

“Kevin?” She asked, walking father into the bathroom, wondering how the room had accumulated so much steam when the door had been left open slightly. She walked past their roomy cabinets, the mirror, and the sink before stopping to stand between the large bathtub and the shower.

“Kev—ACK,” she said, someone grabbing her arm and yanking her into the shower. The shower that was *running* with very *warm* water. She shrieked, moving against the wall and trying not to get wet. Near her, someone laughed.

“So not funny,” she whined, reaching to open the shower door so she could escape. She didn’t even care to look at who it was, she was too preoccupied with escaping.

“Mace,” the voice said, reaching out and grabbing her hand, stopping her from making her way out. She looked up then, her eyes locking with—of *course*—Joe Lucas. He had an amused smile on his lips, eyes dancing with laugher.

Macy swallowed. Her eyes roaming over her bare chest, willing herself not to look any lower. But, really, it was too late, her curious gaze was already moving along the contours of his stomach and to the top of his…*swim trunks*?

“Do you always where swim trunks when you shower?” Macy asked, looking up at him with an amused look on her face.

“Do you always check me out when I’m wearing swim trunks in the shower?”

“This is the first time I’ve been in a shower with you,” she responded, moving a little closer to him before remembering she was here to see *Kevin* and *not* Joe. “Where’s your brother?” She asked.

“What brother?” He responded, tracing his fingertips along her arm. She shivered.

“The brother I’m *dating*,” she responded, “he texted me and told me to—” He cut her off, leaning forward to whisper, seductively in her ear, “We really *should* get you out of those wet clothes.” She swallowed, shivering again.

“But…Kevin…” she tried to protest. Joe chuckled, ending her sentence for her, “isn’t here.” He reached for the bottom of her shirt, pulling it over her head. She made no move to stop him.

“Where?” She asked, watching as he tossed her shirt over the door to the shower. He grabbed the bottom of the cami she had on underneath her shirt, removing that before he answered.

“He’s taking Frankie for ice cream,” Joe responded, “they *should* be gone for quite awhile.” He tossed her cami over the door and started to unzip her skirt.

“But he texted me…” she trailed off, feeling him slide her skirt down her legs. She stepped out of it, accustomed to being in this sort of situation with Joe. She shower was new, but the lack of clothing was not.

“Correction,” Joe said, tossing her skirt and he shoes over the shower door, “*I* texted you from Kevin’s phone.” Macy stared at him for a long moment.

“Joe,” Macy said, “that was incredibly, *stupid*. What if he *reads* it?” Joe shook his head.

“I deleted it,” Joe said, “I *know* how to sneak around.” Macy stared at him questioningly.

“You’ve done this before?” She asked, head tilted to the side, eyebrows raised. Joe shook his head.

“Not what I meant,” he responded, tracing the strap of her bra from her shoulder all the way to the top of her breast. She swallowed. She wanted to ask him what else he could’ve meant by that…but right now her mind didn’t see to know how to form words.

“Macy,” he whispered her name in a soft warning, reaching up and tugging her hair tie out of her hair, and pressing her against the wet wall of she shower with such force that it knocked the air out of her lungs. Joe was *always* rough and a *little* unconventional.

She gasped his name, his hand slipping between her legs, drawing circles against her thigh with his finger. She whimpered and moaned, arching her back into him and parting her legs farther to give him more access.

He grabbed a fistful of her hair and pulled her head back, pressing his lips against her neck roughly. She gasped when he nipped at her flesh. He was being so *forceful* tonight, so *seductive.*

“J-joe,” she breathed, pressing her palms against his back and resisting the urge to dig her nails into him. He took a small bit of the skin from her neck into his mouth, sucking gently. If only Kevin would touch her like this she wouldn’t be in this situation. She wouldn’t have to betray her best friend and her boyfriend. She wouldn’t *crave* this attention from *him*.

He moved his hand higher, tracing his finger along the line of her panties. She swallowed, nails digging into his back. He hissed, moving his hand up, fingertips tracing over her stomach, upwards to her neck.

She wondered how far he would go tonight when he traced his fingers along her bra, moving both his hands from their previous positions to rest on the clasps holding the article of clothing against her skin. He unclasped the first one and Macy took a deep breath. The air around them was moist, the water spraying against her skin. It felt nice, almost as nice as the feeling of his stomach pressed against her and his fingers undoing the second clasp.

There was one left, she realized. His fingers lingered on that one for a long moment. It was as if he were asking her if she was *sure*. She didn’t think he had to ask permission. They were both in a situation where they were using the other to satisfy whatever need their current, incredibly devoted, significant others could not satisfy. She was in no position to deny him.

He undid the last clasp, moving himself closer to her as he slid his hands up her back, pushing the straps of her bra off. She held back a whimper, feeling the fabric slide over her skin, shortly followed by his fingers. He was going slow, teasing her. She found that she liked it when he did that.

“Joe?” Someone asked, entering the bathroom, the two of them pulled apart, Macy clutching her bra to her body and praying silently that no one saw her clothing scattered all over the floor.

“In the shower here, Kev,” Joe said, “Invasion of privacy much?” Macy’s stomach churned, her heart racing.

*Please don’t let Kevin see my clothes, please don’t let Kevin see my clothes*, she thought, trying to stay as quiet as she could with Kevin still standing in the room.

For a few *very* long moments, Kevin remained in the bathroom with them. He didn’t come any farther into the room, instead, he lingered close to the doorway.

“Oh,” he said after awhile and that was basically all he said, turning around and leaving the room. He shut the door behind him and Macy let loose a sigh of relief. Joe looked at her and he sighed too, pressing his forehead against hers.

“Oh god,” she said, her heart still racing, “oh god.” Joe wrapped his arms around her and pulled her against him, burying his face in her neck.

“Calm down, Macy,” he whispered, “at least we didn’t get caught.” Macy swallowed hard.

“Yeah,” she said, “but how the *hell* am I supposed to get out of here?” Joe pulled away, looking down at her thoughtfully.

“I think I might have an idea.”

END &amp; BEGIN AGAIN

“Joe,” Macy said, her voice dangerous, “there is *no* way I’m going through that window with a harness on and in *soaking* wet clothes.” Joe chuckled, watching as she shivered in her wet clothes, rubbing her hands over her arms in a vain attempt to get warm.

“You could always go down naked.” Macy blushed and slapped his arm.

“I’m not doing that either!” Joe rolled his eyes and walked over to the counter, picking up the clothes he had set out for himself and walking back to her.

“Wear these,” he responded, pushing an old t-shirt and a pair of athletic shorts into her chest. She stared at him questioningly.

“You’re going to leave the bathroom in swim trunks?” She asked and Joe laughed at her.

“Macy,” he said, a smile curling across his lips, “I live upstairs with my brothers. I can leave the shower with a towel wrapped around my waist. Sure, they’re probably gonna make some “put some clothes on” cracks, but I’ll be fine. You, on the other hand, have to go out that window. And *soon*.” Macy sighed.

“Why do you have a harness in the bathroom anyway?” She asked, looking back over at it.

“For the same reason we live in a firehouse,” Joe responded.

“Well, why’s that?”

“Not sure,” he responded, “now, take those wet clothes off and get out the window. Stop stalling.” Macy scoffed.

“I though you *wanted* me here, Joe,” Macy said, trying her hand at being seductive as she made her way towards him, using her fingers to climb his chest up toward his shoulder. He smirked and grabbed her hand.

“I *do*,” he whispered, using the hand that he had placed over hers to trace over her arm, over her shoulder and neck so that he could caress her face, “but Stella is going to be here soon…” he trailed off and Macy growled somewhere deep in her throat.

*Stella*, she thought, teeth grinding. The girl was her *best friend*, but lately she seemed to be ruining *everything*. Macy swallowed, chewing her lip. Where’d that thought come from? *She* was the one ruining everything. Stella wasn’t cheating on Joe with Macy’s boyfriend.

“Whatever,” Macy said, stripping her wet clothing off quickly and throwing Joe’s pajamas over her head. Joe watched her, but she was going too fast for him to enjoy it.

“You look good in my clothes,” he said. Macy frowned and rolled her eyes.

“Strap me in,” She commanded as she went and stood by the harness he would lower her from the window with.

“Yes, ma’am,” Joe responded, a smirk on his lips. Macy ignored how cute that smirk was, she was still a little miffed about being cut short because of *Stella*. Again, she wondered why she was so upset. Stella wasn’t doing anything wrong.

END &amp; BEGIN AGAIN

Macy’s feet hit the pavement with a soft, thud. Joe stuck his head out the window and looked down at her. She gave him a thumbs up, unhooking herself from the harness and making her way out of the alley.

“Macy?” She heard someone ask just as she had made it out. She turned quickly, going into a tae kwon doe stance. She hoped it wasn’t some crazy rapist or ax murderer.

“Uh…Stella…” She said. This was *much*worse than either of her previous assumptions.

“What are you doing here?” Stella asked, walking closer to her friend. *Crap. Crap. Shit. Oh god.*Macy thought, smiling nervously and trying to back up into the alley without looking too suspicious.

“I was…uh…” Macy said, “I was just taking a—”Stella cut her off, “Are those *Joe’s* clothes?” She asked. Macy blanched.

“No,” she said, laughing nervously, “why would I be wearing Joe’s clothing…*honestly*, Stella.” Another nervous laugh.

“Those *are* his clothes…” Stella said, eyeing her best friend suspiciously.

“It’s not what you think…” She said defensively, “I…I…” she trailed off.

“I *knew* you were still obsessed with JONAS,” Stella said.

“What?” Macy asked before realizing that this was an easy out, “oh crap. You caught me, Stella.” Stella crossed her arms.

“Stealing clothes, Macy?” Stella asked, “*really*?” Macy squeaked and nodded.

“Yeah,” she said, “I couldn’t help myself…” she trailed off, giving Stella an “I feel so bad and so apologetic” look. Stella sighed and reached out, grabbing her best friend’s arm.

“Does Joe know that you took—wait…why are you *wet*?” Macy’s eyes went wide. She opened her mouth to reply, only to close it again.

“Uh…well…you *just* missed it, Stell,” she began, “freak rain. You know how it is around here sometimes…” Stella stared at her for a long time, eyes narrowing.

“Whatever,” she said, “you’re coming with me to return those clothes. Your obsession is so *weird*. I *really* thought you got over that when you started dating Kevin…honestly, Macy…” Stella continued to scold her, but Macy wasn’t worried about it anymore. She sighed.

Just when she had finally gotten out, Stella had to pull her back in.

Uuuuh. I think everyone is a little OOC, but I guess that’s the point of this whole story. I tried to write it as OC as I could. Read and Review! I love getting feedback!
