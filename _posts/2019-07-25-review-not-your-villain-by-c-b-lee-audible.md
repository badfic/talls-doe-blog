I got this title on audible like I do most of my traditional publishing reads and as much as it pains me because I adored the first one, I’m going to have to DNF book 2.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.desdemonawren.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/nyv1.gif?resize=600%2C385&ssl=1)</figure>I love Bells and I would have loved to follow his story especially his whole Chameleon thing, but C.B Lee doesn’t do anything interesting with him. Most of the book he pines over Emma in the most annoying way possible.

Then he whines when she gets a boyfriend and starts acting like a bad friend. Which was so annoying to me and made even *more* annoying by the voice actor they had reading the book that I had to stop listening.

It’s like this book was written by a completely different person. In book 1, Jess loved running and training and she wanted to be a hero. In book 2, Jess is a whiny lazy grump who is useless on most missions.

This turned me off so badly because I really genuinely loved Jess and seeing her stripped down to a whiny comic relief archetype was horrible.

Overall rating: ★  
(1/5 Stars – DNF)

I really hope the next novel C.B Lee puts out is better than this.
