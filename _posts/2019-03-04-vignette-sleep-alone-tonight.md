> “Hanging out with you these past few weeks made me realize  
> why I broke up with you”

and then I asked him

> “Why?”

and he said

> “Because I don’t love you and I never will again”

and I felt like I was falling into an abyss.

> “Oh”

was the best response my head came up with.

Then I walked all the way back to my apartment in the dark  
alone.
