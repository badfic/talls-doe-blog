i’ve got shades of indigo and violet  
beneath my eyes, showing what  
*i lack*,   
<sub>have been *lacking*</sub>

i’m living in a neverending shade of  
blue, the hue appears on the corners  
of my vision and overtakes my emotions,  
choking what little happiness I’ve aquired  
**out** of me.

i’ve got green hidden in the brown in my eyes  
specks of leaves in the wooded color i’ve come  
to think of as *soft* and inviting  
<sub>is that how you feel too?</sub>  
<sup>when you look into my eyes?</sup>  
<sup>\[buthowwouldyouknow?you.never.look\]</sup>

i’ve got yellow hidden deep  
a beginning of a fire that i hide from  
the shades of blue comsuming me so often  
it’s my warmth, the color of the butterflies  
flying around and around and around.

i’ve got orange on my toes  
to remind me of my creativity  
that never quite goes away;  
it’s metallic hue is almost calming.

i’ve got red in my heart and in my veins  
its the color i see   
\[*most often;  
but in reality,   
you’re all these colors too*\]  
when i think about you.  
its love and anger and death and blood  
but mostly, it reminds me of you.

i’m a rainbow  
light, vibrancy  
and sometimes hope.

i’m magic explained by science  
and happiness destroyed by pills.
