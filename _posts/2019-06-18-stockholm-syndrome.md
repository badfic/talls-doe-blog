#### TW: Murder, kidnapping, child abuse, sexual assault 

Dear,

I have a confession  
*and I don’t have much time*  
to tell you of my **regrets**

Dear,

I may have killed a man  
*with his own gun*  
my shirt is soaked with his **blood**.

Dear,

He begged for mercy  
*but I didn’t feel merciful tonight*  
is it even really that **bad**  
to kill?

Dear,

I’d like to think he was innocent  
*but he wasn’t.*  
he killed first; he killed my **father**.

Dear,

He told me, as he lay dying  
*that he killed him to protect me*  
that the man wasn’t really my father  
that I was **brainwashed**.

Dear,

I shot him again  
*right between the eyes*  
when he told me his **lie**.

Dear,

The man was clearly delusional  
*and he took away all I had*  
the man who raised me from **birth**  
after my mother abandoned me.

Dear,

If you were afraid,  
*they already caught me*  
after all, I killed him in his **home**  
a Police Station with a big brown dog by his side.

Dear,

The sirens were so loud,  
*just like the night daddy died*  
when they took me from his home **at**  
the tender age of thirteen and thrust me into   
the arms of a woman with long brown hair who  
looked a lot like me.

Dear,

They told me the woman was my mother  
*they’re all a bunch of liars*  
my mother was a whore. Daddy said she’s   
**dead** by now. Rotting in some ditch  
just outside of Jersey.

Dear,

Daddy said I’d never see her again  
*and then he’d tuck me into his bed*  
every night. And tell me how special I am  
and how I’m his “beautiful” girl.

Dear,

Daddy loved me.
