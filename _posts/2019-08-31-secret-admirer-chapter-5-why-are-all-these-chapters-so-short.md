Okay, yeah. I really wanna get this finished. Totally craving a sweet Macy/Kevin moment =).

. . . . . . . . .

Macy got to school as early as she could the next day. She was so excited about getting another note from her secret admirer. It was the best feeling in the world to know that someone liked her, but it sucked not knowing who it was. When she turned around that familiar corner, she noticed that Stella was already at the locker waiting for her.

“What are you doing here so early, Stella?” Macy asked, turning to her locker and dialing the combination. Stella didn’t answer at first, watching her best friend open her locker, holding her breath. This would be the last note and she couldn’t wait to see the look on her face when…

Macy opened her locker, watching with her eyes wide as a couple of handfuls of rose petals fell at her feet along with a note on off-white parchment-looking paper. Stella almost squealed, but tried to hold it in for the sake of Kevin, Joe, and Nick’s plan.

“I always get here early,” Stella managed to squeak out, a huge smile on her face as she watched Macy bend over to pick up the note. As she was reading it, Joe and Nick came over to join Stella in watching Macy get incredibly excited. When she had finished, she folded it back over, and held it to her chest, releasing a squeal. Joe and Nick winced, Stella, knowing this would happen, had already plugged her ears.

“Think I just went deaf,” Nick whispered.

“What?” Joe asked loudly. Nick and Stella both glared at him.

“Stella, Stella,” Macy said, jumping up and down and grabbing her friend’s shoulders, “oh my gosh, Stella,” Macy was finding it hard to breathe, again. Stella smiled awkwardly and placed her own hands on Macy’s shoulders, trying to stop her from jumping around.

“Breathe, Macy,” Stella said, taking a few breaths as an example.

“He wants me to meet him in the atrium after school!” She shrieked. Again, the boys winced. Stella was used to her behavior.

“Really?” All three of them asked at once, Stella glared back at them, as if to tell them to let her handle this because it was already obvious enough with them lingering behind her by Macy’s locker.

“Yes!” She squealed.

“That’s so great,” Stella said with a huge smile on her face. Macy jumped up and down a few more times with glee. The two brothers and Stella watched, all three secretly planning the next move.

“Anyways,” Macy said as she stopped jumping, “I gotta run, I don’t want to be late for class!” She grabbed some books out of her locker, slammed it shut and skipped off down the hallway. They all watched her go and once she was out of sight, Stella turned to the brothers behind her.

“Operation Secret Admirer is a go,” she said. Joe and Stella smiled at each other, mischievous looks on their faces.

“What are you doing?” Nick asked after a few moments of watching them. The two stopped staring at each other and shot a look in Nick’s direction before dispersing to go to their next classes.

. . . . . . . . .

I apologize for the shortness of it, this is really only just a filler =). The real action is going to be in the next chapter. And then a follow up with the notes since so many of you are dying to read them. And I am so dreading writing them =P.
