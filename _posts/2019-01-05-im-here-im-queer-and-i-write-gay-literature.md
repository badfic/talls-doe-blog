(YES IT RHYMES, SHUT UP, SHARON.)

I see a lot of posts on here where people complain about not having queer representation in literature. And most of the time, I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúSame‚Äù, *but* I‚Äôve also written a book about a trans female who falls in love with a nymph ([whose entire culture is based on a trans identity](https://amazon.com/Bloom-Monster-Novella-Desdemona-Wren-ebook/dp/B07B4SLH9S/ref=la_B07B4WG4S8_1_1?)) so.

**I‚Äôm not saying you guys, like, have to read it, but I‚Äôm not *not* saying that.**

Look, I wanna write more gay literature in the future. So it‚Äôd be nice if [Bloom](https://amazon.com/Bloom-Monster-Novella-Desdemona-Wren-ebook/dp/B07B4SLH9S/ref=la_B07B4WG4S8_1_1?) sold. Its got a sex scene in it, its got self-acceptance, its got other monsters, and a whole slew of other things.

(No vampires in this one, though. The Monster Love series is more about monsters that don‚Äôt get much love, so. I do have vampires in Marjorie Diaz, though).

I‚Äôll keep plugging away at representation in the future. Especially for all my monster lover friends out there. There may also be unicorns in the future. \*Wiggles fingers ominously\*. And time travel. You never know.

But expect more gay shit from me. And maybe even one single straight thing cause Nighthawks, the second novella in the Monster Love Series is pretty straight.

*BUT*, the main character is POC, most of the characters are female, most of the characters are POC, and there‚Äôs archaeology involved. And also gay birds.

So, like I said, stay tuned for more gay shit and monster porn.

*theeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeenks.*
