“One Last Breath”

A whole month has passed since Sirius had seen the mark, and he hadn’t come back to say ‘I’m sorry.’ He didn’t even come by to say hello. Hannah sighed, she knew it was time to stop dwelling on him. In fact, she was long overdue.

Hannah stared out the window at the world outside and then she got a crazy idea. She wanted to go visit James and Lily! Hannah changed clothes and left quickly. They had already sent her their new address. She didn’t quite understand why they didn’t tell her at the wedding, but oh well.

She had decided to go the muggle way, in a car. She had he license so why not try out her new red convertible? She let the top down and the wind blew through her hair, causing it to flail around violently. She laughed, as she puled onto a back road, and she drove wildly to James’ house.

Upon arrival she knocked on the door loudly. Lily came with a smile on her face, but the smile faded when she saw whom it was. Lily stepped out of the house and shut the door behind her.

“Hannah!” She whispered harshly. “What are you doing here?” Hannah frowned and looked confused.

“Lily…I do not understand…aren’t we friends? Can’t I visit?” Hannah looked hurt and Lily rolled her eyes.

“Hannah Amelia Pettigrew, I have known you since we were 11,” she spat out. Hannah stared at her, not sure what she was getting at. “But I never thought, even in my wildest dreams, that you would do *this*.” Lily grabbed her marked arm and shook it violently. Hannah’s eyes widened. Sirius had told her!

“Lily…I…” She started. Lily put her hand up and shook her head.

“I don’t want to hear it *Pettigrew*,” Lily spat at her, “There is no room in my house for one of *his* followers.” Lily walked back inside, and before Lily slammed the door Hannah caught a glimpse of Peter. Rage consumed her and she stormed off, opening the car door and she drove around awhile before realizing she should go to the Wizarding realm. She smirked to herself and parked her car in her driveway. Stuffing the keys in her pocket, she went to the sidewalk and stuck out her wand hand.

A huge bus appeared before her that instant and she boarded. The driver and bus boy smiled at her. She had been on here before. Many times and everyone knew her by name; even the old lady that was always on when anyone boarded.

“Where we headed tonight Ms. Hannah?” Hannah smiled, and tapped her lip for a moment before answering.

“Where I usually go Billy,” The boy nodded and smiled sincerely. Hannah wished he hadn’t because his teeth looked almost as hideous as Voldamort’s face. She chucked to herself as the ride went on in silence. When they stopped everything went forward, but Hannah was used to his by now.

“Last stop Ms. Hannah.” Hannah smiled at him gratefully and got off the bus, entering the leaky caldron.

“‘Lo ‘Annah,” the bar tender said without looking up. She smiled and passed him for the entrance to the portal. She pushed the bricks in and she then entered the Wizarding world. She breathed deep and smiled.

Hannah walked down the streets alone looking in the stores and such. She saw mothers and children and every sort of thing. She saw a pet store and she entered it. She had lost he owl and cat to age at Hogwarts, so she felt the need to buy another pet. It was kind of awkward going in there, because of all the memories it brought back.

She remembered getting Shadow and Glimmer here. What an exciting day that was. She was just starting her first year at Hogwarts and her mother had got her a kitten. She loved that little kitten so much, it had been completely black with amber colored eyes. She loved it dearly, but…she also wanted an owl to send letters to home and to other people so she wouldn’t have to wait for her mother’s owl to come. So her mother had gotten it for her, but she had to send it to Hogwarts with Peter, who mistreated her greatly. Peter had a rat, and that was all he cared about.

She laughed, remembering when Peter got so hungry he had eaten the poor little thing. She thought about the saying ‘You are what you eat.’ That was definitely what had happened to Peter. Since his Animangus form was a rat, the saying was so true! Well, for him anyway.

She spotted some kitties over in the corner and she went to pet them, but before she could get there she noticed there was a rather large cat in a cage. She blinked and rubbed her eyes before realizing it was an honest to goodness, Black Panther. She let out a gasp and the clerk noticed her reaction.

“Ma’am…” The clerk said, getting her attention. She looked down at him and smiled.

“Yes?” She asked sweetly, with a fake smile painted across her face. The panther’s eyes locked on her face and it sat down in its cage.

“The large cat has taken quite a liking to you, but it scares off most my other customers, would you like to take it?” Hannah smiled widely and grinned.

“Of course!” she man smiled and handed her chain link leash.

“Take it…Good-bye!” The man rushed off before Hannah had the chance to ask him how much. She sighed, figuring the cat was free, she took it from its cage and walked out the door. Today had turned out to be an odd day. (A/N: The panther is just a kitten so it’s not full-grown. It is about the size of a cub)

As Hannah walked down the street people gawked and stared, but she was used to that now, for Merlin’s sake she was walking around with a panther cub. Hannah shook her head and laughed. This was awkward, she never thought she’d be here, in the Wizarding world, walking a big cat down the road.

Lost in her thoughts Hannah didn’t notice the cat speed up and start after a person a little ahead of her. She screamed, coming back to reality. The person her cat was after, turned around and looked alarmed. Hannah’s eyes got wide.

“Severus!” She yelled, losing control of the cat, “Get out of the way!” Hannah fell onto the ground, the cat dragging her onward. The cat dragged her the remainting six feet to Severus before she was stopped.

Severus looked down at her a worried expression on his face. Hannah laughed, and he smiled knowing she was okay.

“Fancy seeing you here,” she said staring up at him. Severus smiled at her, and stood, offering his hand. She took it and he helped her stand.

“Thank you Severus,” she said, walking on. Severus followed and offered to take the cat for her. Hannah shook her head no, and he gave her a stern look. She blinked, and handed him the leash.

They walked on, a pleasant conversation filled the air around them, and their friendship grew. Sure they were friends at Hogwarts, but when she started to hang around Sirius and his lot. They lost touch. Hannah pushed her hair out her face and looked forward. Her heart skipped a beat, and she stopped moving. Severus turned to her, concerned once more.

“Hannah…” He said quietly, but she didn’t say a word she just kept looking forward, fear on her face. Severus followed her eyes and noticed Sirius Black standing a few feet away, staring at her. He approached with a smirk on his face.

“What’s the matter Hannah you can’t do any better than Snape?” He asked, hitting her shoulder with his and knocking her over as he passed. Hannah watched him go as mutely as she had let him got a month ago.

Hannah felt like she was falling, even when Snape helped her up. She was down to one last breath, or so it seemed. She stared at Severus blankly before hugging him and crying on his shoulder.

“Hold me now,” Hannah pleaded, Snape wrapped his arms around he waist, feeling really nervous. Hannah felt like she was six feet from the edge and still falling. If only she could look deeper and realize that maybe six feet wasn’t so far down.

Please come now I think I’m falling

I’m holding on to all I think is safe

It seems I found the road to nowhere

And I’m trying to escape

I yelled back when I heard thunder

But I’m down to one last breath

And with it let me say

Let me say

Hold me now

I’m six feet from the edge and I’m thinking

That maybe six feet

Ain’t so far down

I’m looking down now that it’s over

Reflecting on all of my mistakes

I thought I found the road to somewhere

Somewhere in His grace

I cried out heaven save me

But I’m down to one last breath

And with it let me say

Let me say

Hold me now

I’m six feet from the edge and I’m thinking

That maybe six feet

Ain’t so far down

Sad eyes follow me

But I still believe there’s something left for me

So please come stay with me

‘Cause I still believe there’s something left for you and me

For you and me. For you and me

Hold me now

I’m six feet from the edge and I’m thinking

Creed-Once Last Breath-
