It’s like this:  
you wait a lifetime to hear hello  
but all they wanna say is good-bye  
you wait forever to be their reason  
but all they wanna tell you is a lie.

It’s like you smile for something you’re gonna lose  
waiting for that person to notice you’re not playing  
you want something serious, but they’re not into it.

So they leave you there and you don’t know what to say  
they break your heart and you wait, just wait.
