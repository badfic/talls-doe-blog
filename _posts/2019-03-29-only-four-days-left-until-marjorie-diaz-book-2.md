The second book in my Marjorie Diaz series is coming out **April 2, 2019**! You can [preorder](https://amazon.com/gp/product/B07P86KDNM) it on Amazon now!

**From the official synopsis:**

**“Marjorie Diaz has been marked for death.**  
  
*After her relationship with Patrick Watkins ends, Marjorie discovers that everyone in her life has been lying to her. Even her best friend, Lucian Maravalle.*   
 *Now, Marjorie is being hunted by a powerful magical family who will stop at nothing to kill her.   
  
Lucian and her family have sworn to protect Marjorie from these nightmarish beasts, but Marjorie isn’t sure she can trust them. They keep secret after secret and, even after Marjorie has begged for them to tell her everything, they continue to keep her in the dark.   
  
Marjorie struggles with her own mortality as she embarks on a futile journey to remain alive and reason with the beings that are hunting her.   
  
She finds out the hard way that humans don’t matter on the other side of the veil. Unless Marjorie has something of use to offer, she’s better off dead.*
