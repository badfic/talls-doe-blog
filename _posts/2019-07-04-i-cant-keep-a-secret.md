I don’t want to miss you  
I’m so *angry* I feel heavy  
*overcome* by so many emotions  
I don’t know where to start.  
  
**I don’t want to miss you**  
I’ll start there, it’s self-explanatory  
but, don’t you want to know my reason?  
  
If I don’t miss you  
you can’t **hurt** me  
you can’t make me *feel* this way  
if I don’t miss you then I don’t  
**love you**.  
  
But let’s get real here,  
I *do* love you  
and I *do* miss you   
so how do I make the pain stop?  
  
That’s the second thing on the agenda  
**how do I make the pain stop**  
The answer? *I don’t*  
because I’m not telling you  
I *won’t* tell you.  
  
**You tell me I can’t keep a secret**  
if only you knew the secrets I’ve been keeping  
from you, from your family, from my friends  
let’s dish, shall we?  
  
I am full of so much anger, hate, bitterness  
because I fell in love with you  
*I am so angry* that I had to  
**fall in love** with someone who is so  
*stupid* that he’d cast me aside  
like a **rag doll**.  
  
I hate this emotion so much  
love? love? LOVE?  
They tell you it’s magic  
that it’s beautiful,   
but all it is is ***PAIN***  
wrapped up in golden paper  
and coated in chocolate.  
  
**You want to know *all* the things I keep from you?**  
*I love you* **I’m in love with you** you’re my  
*everything* and I’m *scared*.   
I waited for *so long* to be in love, but now?  
*now* I wish I’d never felt anything like this.  
I wish I’d never met you.  
I HATE THIS.  
  
I’m so **angry** that I can’t feel anything but  
**pain, bitterness, resentment** and I can’t  
STOP CRYING. I HATE YOU. I HATE YOU.   
**I HATE YOU**.  
  
<sub>but isn’t it funny? that i don’t hate you at all?</sub>
