I’m re-watching the entirety of the MCU, these are my live tweets.

And so it begins. My rewatch of Iron Man is starting….now. Fair warning, this will probably be a thirst thread because I am thirsty for Tony Stark. Thanks for coming to my TED talk.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://i0.wp.com/pbs.twimg.com/media/D6yep3pV4AAZ5vW.jpg?w=685&ssl=1)</figure>Okay they’re in the desert. Nice mountains. Some cars are driving. HELL YEAH CLASSIC ROCK IS PLAYING. I haven’t seen this movie in 10 years so this is kind of all new to me again.

 RDJ speaks and I start giggling.

Oh my god he’s a total asshole.

Tony Stark: I don’t wanna see this on your myspace Me: OH MY GOD I’M OLD.

Oh no oh no oh no. Someone save this poor asshole from these explosions! I’m so upset about these poor soldiers that just died. Also why is his phone making that noise.

Stark Industries bomb: WADDAP   
Me: \*singing Poetic Justice\* BE BETTER, TONY. I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.desdemonawren.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/source.gif?resize=512%2C210&ssl=1)</figure>Wow Tony built his first circuit board at 4. And then his first engine at 6. They made America a woman? Sure don’t seem that way &gt;&gt;.

- - - - - -

WOW OLD RHODEY. I have CHILLS.

Where is Tony? I forgot what happened to him in this scene. Oh right he’s gambling. Of course he is.

WOW HAPPY LOOKS SO DIFFERENT Y’ALL. EVERYONE IS HOT IN THIS MOVIE.

Hello Christine Everhart.

Christine: You’ve been called the DaVinci of our time, what do you say to that?   
Tony: Absolutely ridiculous, I don’t paint.   
Me: HA   
Christine: And what about your other nickname, “The Merchant of Death” Me: oh fuck

Wow Christine and Tony just going at it. Tag yourself I’m JARVIS wakin her up and bein like “Get out. Thanks.”

OH LOOK IT’S CALIFORNIA!

I completely forgot about this part. Why do I keep forgetting things?

Pepper is just like “Hey. Time to leave Christine.”

Christine: After all these years, Tony still has you picking up his dry cleaning   
Pepper: I do anything and everything Mr. Stark requires, including occasionally taking out the trash.   
Me: OH SHIIIIIIIIITTTTTTTT!!!!!!!

- - - - - -

I’m crying about about Pepper and Tony right now. They’re so cute oh my god help? Originally I didn’t care for this relationship, but knowing all I know now I’m like THESE CHILDREN.

Rhodey is so mad. And tbh I would be too. Cause they just straight up replaced him in the second movie lmao.

Even arguing they take the hot towel and I’m like yeah. Yeah hot towels are amazing.

Someone explain to my gay ass why Tony Stark looks so hot here:

<figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://i0.wp.com/pbs.twimg.com/media/D6yizK4V4AAm81D.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure>Uh….Rhodey????????

<figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://i0.wp.com/pbs.twimg.com/media/D6ysyvDV4AAZ7qH.jpg?w=685&ssl=1)</figure>Calm down, Tony Stark, you edge-lord.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://i0.wp.com/pbs.twimg.com/media/D6ys6WIUYAAryP1.jpg?w=685&ssl=1)</figure>THIS MOTHERFUCKING SCENE

<figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://i0.wp.com/pbs.twimg.com/media/D6ys_0qUYAAafct.jpg?w=685&ssl=1)</figure>Why TF is he calling Tony while he’s shirtless? UMMM?? Is this some kind of weird power play or something?

<figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://i0.wp.com/pbs.twimg.com/media/D6ytFS2UcAUIc82.jpg?w=685&ssl=1)</figure>The moment when you see them put the magnet which would eventually become part of the arc reactor into Tony’s chest and you’re like

<figure class="wp-block-image">![?](https://i0.wp.com/abs.twimg.com/emoji/v2/72x72/1f631.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure><figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://i0.wp.com/pbs.twimg.com/media/D6ytQ2eVsAA9GNh.jpg?w=685&ssl=1)</figure>Tony: \*pulling long tube out of his nose\* Me: \*SCREAMING AND GAGGING\* EWWWWWWWAUUGHHH

Tony waking up and finding the arc reactor like “What the fuck???”

For a genius Tony is a fucking moron. You wanna know how that got your guns, Tony? They fucking stole them. Or maybe someone sold them to them. Illegally. Wow did he really think that the US Military were the only people to use his weapons?

Wow he just called Tony the most famous mass murderer in all of history. That’s gotta suck. What an intense wake up call.

And he just refused to build the missile and now they’re torturing him. And now he’s seeing how much of his tech they actually have in this war.

Oh god the moment where Tony realizes they’re going to kill him once he builds the missile and he’s just like “fuck” and I’m like “fuck.”

Tony and Yinsen, hostage bros for life.

Yinsen: That could run your heart for 50 lifetimes   
Tony: …\*looks sad and contemplative\* yeah. Or something big for 15 minutes.   
Me: \*eating a sandwich and sobbing\*

The Ten Rings trying to figure out why the fuck the shit Tony’s making doesn’t look like the picture: Maybe it’s backwards?   
Me: Oh y’all.

NO YINSEN. I mean I know he’s not gonna make it, but like I don’t want him to swallow a hot coal.

Me: \*swooning\*

<figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://i0.wp.com/pbs.twimg.com/media/D6yt61NUcAAW4Or.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure>OH MAN TONY IS JUST LIKE TIME TO BLOW EVERYTHING UP.

YINSEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING!

Tony is comin for all y’all bitches.

Dude just shoots metal like the bullet isn’t gonna ricochet. You fucking moron.

Yinsen: My family is dead. I’m going to see them now, Stark, It’s okay. I want this. I want this.   
Me: \*SCREAM CRYING\*   
Tony: Thank you for saving me.   
Me: \*SOBBING\*   
Yinsen: Don’t waste it. Don’t waste your life.   
Me: HE DIDN’T. HE MADE YOU PROUD. \*SOBBING\*

Tony: \*lights people on fire\*   
Me: WOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Tony: \*flies\*   
Tony: \*crashes\*   
Me: Iron Man, everybody.

- - - - - -

THEY FOUND HIM! RHODEY FOUND HIM!

Rhodey: How was the fun-vee   
Tony: laughs   
Me: \*CRIES\*

Did Pepper’s hair become more red with her grief? Or is that just the sunlight?

Me: \*swooning x2\*

<figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://i0.wp.com/pbs.twimg.com/media/D6yv6sSVUAIkZp7.jpg?w=685&ssl=1)</figure>LOOK AT BABY PEPPER WITH THE REDDEST HAIR.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://i0.wp.com/pbs.twimg.com/media/D6ywDIAVUAAc_2l.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure>Tony: Hm. Your eyes are red. A few tears for your long-lost boss?  
Pepper: Tears of joy. I hate job hunting.   
Me: \*MAKES AN INHUMAN NOISE\* STOP BEING SO CUTE I CAN’T HANDLE IT.

A cheeseburger and a press conference. Only one of those things sound like the Tony Stark I know.

Lol Burger King. I love that they used BK because that’s what changed actual RDJ’s life as well.

LOOK WHO IT IS Y’ALL!!!!!!!!!!

<figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://i0.wp.com/pbs.twimg.com/media/D6ywmruUYAE8YnX.jpg?w=685&ssl=1)</figure>I FINALLY KNOW WHAT SHIELD STANDS FOR:   
Strategic   
Homeland   
Intervention   
Enforcement   
&amp; Logistics   
Division   
THAT IS A MOUTHFUL Y’ALL AND COULSON JUST DELIVERS THIS LINE PERFECTLY. THIS MAN IS A GOD.

PEPPER AGREES WITH ME AND I LOVE HER EVEN MORE NOW THANK YOU PEPPER.

Everyone: \*GASPS\*   
Me: YOU BEAUTIFUL MAN YOU MAKE YINSEN PROUD.

Me: \*CRINGING\*

Tony: Make sure you don’t pull out the magnet at the end of it   
Pepper: \*pulls out the magnet\*   
Tony: That was it   
Pepper: OH GOD   
Me: OH GODDDD

Pepper: What’s wrong?   
Tony: Oh nothing I’m just going into cardiac arrest   
Me: \*SCREAMING\*

Pepper: Don’t ever, ever, ever, EVER ask me to do anything like that ever again.   
Tony: \*smoldering eyes\* I don’t have anyone, but you   
Me: \*HYPERVENTILATING\*

Person on tape: You didn’t tell us the person you paid us to kill was the great Tony Stark. As you see Obadiah Stane, your deception will and lies will cost you greatly.   
THIS VIDEO IS HELLA INCRIMINATING. OBADIAH ISN’T COMPETENT I TAKE IT BACK.

OBADIAH IS JUST LIKE HELLO PEPPER. And I’m like PEPPERRRRRRRRRR. Like I haven’t LITERALLY SEEN THIS MOVIE AND ALREADY KNOW WHAT HAPPENS.

Obadiah about to fuckin kill a family of 5 calling them “Collateral damage” FUCKING NIGHTMARE ASSHOLE Then the mom just casually runs Tony Stark over lmao.

Obadiah: I built this company from nothing   
Howard Stark’s Ghost: BITCH U DID WHAT?   
Me: OH MY GOD WHAT THE FUCK. WHY ARE RICH PEOPLE LIKE THIS? THEIR PARENTS/MENTORS GIVE THEM LIKE A MILLION DOLLARS AND THEY’RE LIKE I BUILT MYSELF FROM NOTHING. LIKE NO YOU DIDN’T???

Obadiah: I’ve made some upgrades of my own \*suit flies slow as fuck\* Me: \*sarcastically\* oh wooooooooow. impressive.

HE IS LITERALLY CRUSHING TONY TO DEATH AND I AM SITTING HERE CRYING

 DO IT PEPPER. YOU ABSOLUTE BADASS.

Lol Tony just pulls out his optical connection. Do it to ’em Tony.

Can I just say here that I totally forgot that Obadiah crushed the original Iron Man suit head.

It’s a wonder this didn’t show up in Peter Parker’s room in Spider-Man: Homecoming. Considering how much he likes Star Wars.   
\*waggles eyebrows\* y’all see what I did there?

<figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://i0.wp.com/pbs.twimg.com/media/D6zZnryU8AEXOtr.jpg?w=685&ssl=1)</figure>Time to die Obadiah.

Phil: That’s being taken care of. He’s on vacation. Small aircrafts have such a…poor safety record.   
Me: OHHHH BURNNNNN.

Pepper flirting with Phil is my favorite thing tbh. I ship it. But I literally ship everyone with everyone the same way I do in Naruto.

Tony: \*looking both horny and scared\* …mmhmm?
