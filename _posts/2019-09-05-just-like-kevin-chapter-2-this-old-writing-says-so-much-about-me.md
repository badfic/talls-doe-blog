Well, I’m finally getting around to writing the second chapter of Just Like Kevin! I’ve been kind of dreading it because I lack ideas for this story! It’s like, trying to get from point A to point B has taken the fun out of writing this.

Not sure if I’ll stick with the original ending. I might pull some bits from it, but I like just having things be spontaneous.

Not to mention, my best friend keeps dissing JONAS, so it’s kind of hard for me to write stuff knowing she hates the show (that she’s never watched) so much that she’ll probably never read these :(.

Also, thiscoffeeshop, this is for you.

. . . . . . . .

“So, what kelp project were you talking about, Macy?” Nick asked once Stella and Joe walked off, still in a heated argument. Macy snapped back to reality.

“Look at the time,” Macy said checking her watch and laughing nervously, “I’m going to be late for…” she paused, trying to think of something she could be late for, “dinner.” And with that she took off.

“That was…weird…” Nick said, watching Macy dash down the hallway, not noticing something fall from her back pack.

“Yeah,” Kevin said, leaning down the pick something up off the floor, “She dropped her pencil.” Nick stared down at his brother. “What?” he asked.

“Nothing, Kev,” Nick said, turning and walking up the staircase and to his next, and final, class of the day.

. . . . . . . .

Macy was breathing heavily, trying to keep her head in the game. It was just practice, but she still liked to have the upper hand. But she found it hard to concentrate with *you know who*blocking her brain.

“What’s wrong with you Misa?” Her couch called when she had missed a pass. She stared at her coach helplessly, lost in her thoughts about the oldest Lucas brother. Her obsession had never been this bad or this distracting before. Sports had always been her outlet. Now she was getting distracted everywhere. She was certain now, even though she might have been certain before…that she had feelings for Kevin other than friendship and other than him being one third of her favorite band.

“My head just isn’t in the game today coach,” she said when her coach had blown the whistle to signal the end of practice. “I’ll do better tomorrow.”

“You better, Misa,” her coach said, taking the basketball she held from her, “now go hit the showers.” Macy smiled weakly.

“Yes coach,” she said, racing off to join her teammates in the locker room.

You know that feeling you get when you walk into the room and everyone shuts up? The one where you know everyone had been talking about you? Well, this was exactly what Macy Misa, star athlete and JONAS number one superfan was feeling when she walked into the locker room. She knew she had sucked on the court today, but she didn’t know her sucking was really all that gossip worthy. She flashed her teammates the same weak smile she had given to her coach and got her things, racing for the showers.

That was awkward.

She usually liked to keep her showers brief, but today she was trying to stay in there for as long as she could. She didn’t want to face her teammates again. Not after the awkward moment from earlier. Not to mention it gave her more time to think, to investigate her feelings. Well, until the water ran ice cold and she was struggling to rince the conditioner out of her hair while taking deep, gulping breaths and trying to think of a warm place. Like being in Kevin’s a-okay, another warm place. Like the desert. That was better.

Once she had successfully finished washing her hair, she wrapped her towel around her, and still shivering, struggled to get dressed. When she had finished, she was relieved to see that all of her teammates were now gone. Probably at home or on their way home. It just made it that much easier for her to pack up the rest of her things and get out of there. Without another awkward moment.

She took one last look around the locker room, making sure she had everything and then exited. She started to make her way towards the front doors of the school, but stopped when she saw the person she least wanted to see right now in the whole world. So much for not having a second awkward moment.

“Hey Macy,” Kevin said once he had noticed her. She swallowed, watching as he pushed himself away from the wall he had been leaning on and walked towards her.

“What are you doing here?” She asked, her eyes wide. Something he could easily misinterpret as a fangirl stare, but what she was feeling right now wasn’t fangirl anything. It was genuine nervousness. She felt like she was going to faint or throw up. Or both. She hoped it was neither, but that wasn’t how logic worked in her world.

“I was in the neighborhood,” he said with a grin. She swooned inwardly, her heart pounding. She was finding it hard to breathe. All the symptoms of a fangirl moment, but this time something felt newer, different from all the previous times. Other than the fact that she hadn’t caused Kevin physical harm of any kind. *Yet.*

“Were you waiting for me?” She asked. She was shaking now. That was new. She brushed it off as shivering from the cold water she had just showered in. It had nothing to do with Kevin as far as she was concerned.

“Well,” Kevin said, grinning again and holding out a pencil, “you dropped this earlier.”

“Oh,” Macy said, taking the pencil from him, hand still shaking embarrassingly, “thanks.”

“Are you okay?” Kevin asked, noticing now that she was shivering.

“Ran out of hot water,” she said, smiling, “I guess I’m still a little…cold.” Kevin frowned, taking off his jacket and draping it over her shoulders, his hand brushing against her neck gently as he pulled it back.

And the world went black again.

. . . . . . . .

There ya go, thiscoffeeshop. I decided to add a little touch in there just for you. I really need to write something more sensual. This second chapter is so much different from the first. I mean, it’s kind of the same, but it feels so different. I think there’s just a ton of awkwardness in this chapter.
