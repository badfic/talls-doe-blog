She paints the stars on his bedroom walls  
and bends the shapes into perfect symmetry  
she kisses his eyelids and cups his face  
and she still holds his hand and closes her eyes  
when he kisses her and she knows  
without a doubt that she loves him

He paints the clouds on her canvas  
and makes straight lines out of coat hangers  
he kisses her forehead and caresses her throat  
and he still holds her hand and moves strands of hair  
from her face and he tells her he’s clouded  
and not like the stars, but she knows what he means

*She* pushes for liberation  
fills his head with lies and false accusations  
whispers in his ears that there’s no way this is right  
that there’s no balance of control and there’s no balance  
at all and there’s no love in this and for a moment  
he’s swayed and blanketed, confused  
but he remembers…

She paints the stars on his bedroom walls  
and kisses him softly, holds him in the night  
and whispers gently in his ear that everything will be okay  
and they’ll make it because they always do  
and he believes her because he knows she’d never lie.
