### From Mine, 13’s, and Ariel LeAnn’s Asylum Wolves Story.

Darien is the first vampire he’s ever seen. He had no idea they would be so beautiful. Daciana and Areynn had always warned him away from them, the clans in the city didn’t get along with wolves, after all.

But he couldn’t help it. He was curious.

Darien Taylor was by far the most beautiful man he had ever laid eyes on. He had long silver hair and pale greyish skin that made him look godlike. Faizeel supposed that was the point of vampires. To look pretty so they could entice their prey to come to them.

Werewolves were different. At least, in Faizeel’s experience. Instead of preying on people they generally preferred animals. Or at least he did when he was hunting. He hadn’t been a wolf long enough to consider humans prey just yet.

Hell, four months ago he was human himself. He wouldn’t want to be eaten by some giant hell beast. So he would stick to moose for now.

“Greetings,” a man’s voice said from beside him. It was low and filled with amusement.

Faizeel nearly jumped out of his skin. When had Darien gotten beside him?

“For a wolf you’re not very observant,” Darien said.

“Wh-what?” Faizeel stammered, completely caught off guard.

Darien rested his hand on the wall beside Faizeel’s face and leaned into him. His eyes were bright red with a hint of black around the iris. “What brings you out here, wolf?” Darien looked him up and down, gaze lingering on his throat a little too long.

“Isn’t your kind nocturnal?” His gaze flicked back up from Fai’s throat to meet his eyes. He bit his lip, a hint of fang poking out.

“I could say the same thing about your kind, bat.” Fai snarled.

Darien straightened up and flashed him an easy smile. “Bat!” He guffawed, almost taken aback. “I suppose I should have expected that.”

Faizeel narrowed his eyes at him and crossed his arms over his chest.

“I’ll let you in on a little secret though, wolf,” Darien said, exposing his fangs, “Vampires don’t actually turn into bats. Or, at least not all species of vampires. Most turn into mist or wind or something equally as useless. Teleporting would have been so much easier.” He looked wistful.

“There’s more than one species of vampire?” Faizeel asked.

Darien chuckled. “Of course. There are also multiple species of werewolves. Different species evolve in different ways.”

Faizeel hadn’t thought of it that way. Daciana and Areynn had told him there were other wolves out there that were different from them, but he just thought it had to do with what they ate. He never thought there could be an evolutionary thing.

“Your kind of werewolf is severely allergic to both silver and wolfsbane,” Darien continued, “There are species out there immune to both of those with a severe allergy to gold or even the sun depending.”

“I thought a sun allergy was a vampire thing.” Fai said.

Darien smirked at this. “I suppose that is an issue for some vampires, but.” he paused to gesture to the sun high in the sky, “Not all of them.” His gaze settled back on Fai before he continued in a low voice, “You have much to learn, pup.”

Faizeel felt goosebumps erupt on his skin. No one other than Daciana and Areynn had ever called him that before. Something about the way Darien said it made his stomach clench and head rise up in his cheeks.

“You should run along home now,” Darien said, flashing his fangs again, his eyes darting to Faizeel’s throat.

Faizeel’s heart pounded in his chest. Logically he knew he should leave. Vampires and werewolves didn’t mix. He had learned that from TV and books even before he was part of this world. Another part of him desperately wanted to know the feeling of Darien sinking his teeth deep into his neck and draining him dry.

“Do vampires have hypnosis?” Faizeel asked, biting the inside of his cheek, fighting against whatever urge Darien seemed to be pushing on him.

The vampire took in a deep breath, leaning closer. His lips brushed against the shell of Faizeel’s ear. He stroked his fingers over Fai’s arm from his elbow all the way down to his wrist and Fai shivered.

“You were mine the second you started watching me,” Darien whispered.
