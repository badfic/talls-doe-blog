Floating in mid-air, round, simple, clear  
we’re caught in a bubble, a small little circle  
of love, life, and all the simple things  
you’re my world and you don’t know it.

It’s so easy to fall in love with you  
you’re patient, sweet, full of :heart:  
and I miss you when we go into those  
two separate ways, headlights facing apart.

I can’t begin to describe how hard it is  
to stretch a bubble without breaking   
the heart.
