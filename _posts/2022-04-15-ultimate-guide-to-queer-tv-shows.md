Hey friends! I know it’s been like, what, a year since I posted anything on this blog? Life got busy and I’ve started and abandoned at least a dozen or so posts, much to the annoyance of my web admin who had to make this wordpress install for me. Anyways, I’ve decided to come back with a bang.

I’ve been seeing a lot of people complain that they don’t know where to find queer content or what to Queer TV Shows to watch for ultimate queertitude, so I have made A LIST. This is only the lists of shows I have watched and mostly enjoyed with my top recommendations, well, at the top.

*\*Kim’s Convenience had a queer subplot for Janet in the final season, but it was cut short before they really explored that for her and I’m still kind of mad about it.*
