Sooo. I was sitting here and wondering, should I update or should I not update? Guess which one I picked. Go on. Guess.

Just Like Kevin

Chapter Seven

. . . . . . . . . . .

Kevin shifted around in his seat, trying to get comfortable. He discovered that cars weren’t made to be comfortable to sleep in. Maybe he had made the wrong choice to stay in the car with Macy. Maybe he should’ve just woken her up. He shifted again, turning his body towards her.

She took a deep breath, her body shuddering a little. He watched as her head slipped a little against the window and a few strands of hair fell into her face. His heart raced and he concentrated on breathing as he reached across and moved the hair from her face. His fingers brushed against her warm skin and he felt butterflies erupt in his stomach. As he watched her there was no doubt in his mind that he had made the right choice.

Macy stirred slightly, mumbling something in her sleep and sighing. He found himself wondering what she was dreaming about and hoping that somehow he made an appearance in her dreams. It was beautiful like this. Just sitting in his car and watching her sleep.

Macy stirred again, her eyes fluttering open, unaware of Kevin watching her. She stretched, arching her back in away that made Kevin’s breathing hitch. She yawned and raised her arms over her head, yelping in panic as her hand hit the roof of Kevin’s car. She jumped in the seat and looked around frantically. Kevin swallowed hard, trying to get the mental image of her arching her back and the thoughts that came with it out of his mind.

“Good morning, sleeping beauty,” Kevin remarked, with a smile on his face. He was glad he found his voice. Macy’s eyes went wide.

“Kevin…but…and…holy *sh*–*rap*!” Kevin looked at her, eyebrow raised. He wished he’d stop thinking about her stretching. It was making it hard to concentrate on the fact that she was panicking.

“Shrap?” He asked. It was the only thing he could thing to say, his mind still clouded with impure thoughts about the cute brunette that sat next to him. Macy ignored him, checking her watch.

“It’s *eleven o’clock,*Kevin!” She shrieked, “I’ve missed my morning classes!” Kevin frowned.

“I thought you’d appreciate me letting you sleep, so I stayed out here with you,” he responded, gripping the steering wheel and staring at the dash board. *Stop thinking about Macy like that,*he growled to himself in his thoughts, *Think about…bears in bikinis…mmm Macy in a bi-crap.* Macy’s heart fluttered. He let her sleep…*and*stayed with her?

“Wait…” Macy said, “you let me sleep through my morning classes?”-*And stayed out here with me?* Her heart fluttered again at that thought. Maybe he didn’t want to be *just friends* after all. Kevin kept his eyes glued on the dashboard and nodded.

“Yeah,” Kevin said, “You seemed really tired…and…you looked so peaceful-“*and adorable*-“I didn’t want to disturb you.” Macy didn’t know what to say. It was really sweet that he would let her sleep. Through her early classes. In his car. Alone. With him. She felt her face flush with color and she bit her lip.

“Oh,” she responded, willing the blush to go away, “That was kind of…sweet…I guess.” She stared down at her lap, pulling on the sleeves of her jacket nervously. Kevin bit his lip, wanting to say something, *anything*, but not sure what he should say.

“So…” They both began together, unable to take much more of the tense silence that was building between them. Kevin laughed nervously, glancing in Macy’s direction. Macy blushed and continued to stare down at her lap.

“Uh,” Kevin said after a few moments of silence, “You wanna just go ahead and ditch next period?” He asked, chewing his lip nervously. He hoped she said yes. He didn’t think he could get up in his condition. Let alone walk into the school. Why didn’t he keep a binder handy for these kind of moments? Macy turned and looked at him, confusion evident on her face.

“And do what?” She asked. Kevin felt a light blush creep up in his cheeks. *I will not think impure thoughts about Macy Misa*, Kevin chanted in his head, heart racing, *I wont.*

“Go out,” he said simply, before realizing how forward that sounded and immediately tagging, “for breakfast.” to the end. Kevin played with the purity ring on his finger nervously, waiting for her response. And trying to remind himself why thinking impure thoughts about a girl he was alone with in a car was so bad. *Especially*right now. When did he start to like her so much anyhow? He guessed it might’ve been the first time her heard her sing…

“You mean, brunch?” Macy asked, snapping him from his thoughts and motioning to the time on his dashboard.

“Or an early lunch,” Kevin remarked. Or maybe he started liking her when-Macy laughed and smiled at him, running her fingers through her hair self-consciously. Kevin concentrated on breathing.

“Whatever it is,” she began, “It’s so worth skipping my next class.” Kevin smiled awkwardly, reminding himself to take another breath as she ran a finger over her lips, checking her lip gloss. He wondered what flavor she used. Maybe she’d let him taste it…

“Where to?” He asked, pushing the last thought from his mind. Macy paused for a minute, wondering what she was in the mood for.

“I dunno,” she responded, tapping her bottom lip with her index finger. Kevin swallowed.

“What are you in the mood for?” he asked. *Crap*…he thought. He hoped she didn’t take that like he just thought it. *I pledge allegiance to the flag…*

“I could really go for some Starbucks right now,” she responded, “Their cinnamon rolls are *addicting*.” Kevin laughed this time, starting his car. He was glad that now he could stop concentrating on Macy and start concentrating on his driving.

“Addicting cinnamon rolls here we come,” he said, putting the car in reverse and backing out.

“I can’t believe we’re ditching,” she said with a mischievous giggle. Kevin smiled and shook his head.

“I can’t either,” he responded, pulling out of the school parking lot and onto the main road it was on, “but I’m glad that I am.”

“Why?” Macy asked with an amused look on her face. Kevin smiled sweetly, turning to look at her as the car slowed to a stop at a red light.

“Because,” he said, “I get to spend time with you.”
