I was tagged by Lisa Stapleton to write these three things:

## **1. Where are you at in your writing journey?**

I have [a novella](https://amazon.com/Bloom-Monster-Novella-Desdemona-Wren-ebook/dp/B07B4SLH9S/ref=la_B07B4WG4S8_1_1?) and a [full-length novel](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FBWBDYR?ref_=pe_3052080_276849420) published, and a published [anthology piece](https://www.amazon.com/Rags-Riches-Cinderella-Love-Stories-ebook/dp/B07JYW83WY)! I have three more books I’m working on that are done and just need edits. Plus, the new Marjorie Diaz book should come out sometime earlier 2019.

What advice would you give to young writers?** 

Don’t be discouraged if you can’t write every day or if you can only write 100 or 500 words a day at first.

Eventually, you’re going to sit down at your computer and be able to write without thinking about it. And eventually, the more you do it, you’ll be able to crank out 1,000 or 10,000 a day!

But it is not without hard work. Writing sometimes feels like a chore or like pulling teeth and you will be stressed out and upset and angry A LOT. *But* it is so rewarding to put your story out into the world at the end of all that anger and resentment.

Things you need daily in order to function as a writer:** 

-headphones  
-a snack  
-video game break  
-my cats

That’s 4 things, but I think I’ve earned them.
