Most of you know that Scott Westerfeld is my favorite author. I post about him constantly on my social media and tweet at him and I’ve even been retweeted by him. Twice.

So it should come as no surprise that I devoured his new book.

At first, I wasn’t sure how to feel about a new series set in the Uglies universe. I thought the original trilogy was okay. I wasn’t even really a huge fan of Extras. I hardly even remember reading it save for the bits about Tally and a few of the more outrageous body mods.

On page one, I was apprehensive. Then I realized, without even noticing I’d somehow read 50 pages. Then another 50. And another 50 until it was suddenly 5am and I forgot to sleep.

I was so interested in Rafi and Frey and their story and their sisterhood that I literally forgot to sleep. I’m a grown adult. I have a JOB. I had family in town from 3,000 miles away. But I literally couldn’t put this book down.

The romance was great too. Scott Westerfeld is to date the only author who can get me to read and enjoy straight romance. This man is magic. But in all truthfulness, the way Scott gets me to read these kinds of things is by never once making the relationship or romance the sole plot of the story.

Romance can be a bit nausea-making for me. Especially where purple prose is concerned, but Scott has a way of toning all of that down and focusing on his characters and making them so undeniably real you start to feel connected to them.

This was a great read. It brought me back to 13 years ago when I read the first Uglies novel. When I became so connected to Tally’s story and her world that I devoured every book Scott Westerfeld has ever written. Frey and Rafi are so compelling as characters that it leaves me wanting more.

Their story sparked something in me. I cannot wait to read more of this series and to see what else Scott Westerfeld has up his sleeve.

## **More about Impostors**

Frey and Rafi are inseparable . . . two edges of the same knife. But Frey’s very existence is a secret.  
  
Frey is Rafi’s twin sister and her body double. Their powerful father has many enemies, and the world has grown dangerous as the old order falls apart. So while Rafi was raised to be the perfect daughter, Frey has been taught to kill. Her only purpose is to protect her sister, to sacrifice herself for Rafi if she must.  
  
When her father sends Frey in Rafi’s place as collateral in a precarious deal, she becomes the perfect impostor as poised and charming as her sister. But Col, the son of a rival leader, is getting close enough to spot the killer inside her. As the deal starts to crumble, Frey must decide if she can trust him with the truth . . . and if she can risk becoming her own person.  
  
With Impostors, master storyteller Scott Westerfeld returns with a new series set in the world of his mega-bestselling Uglies a world full of twist and turns, rebellion and intrigue, where any wrong step could be Frey’s last.
