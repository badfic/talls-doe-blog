**Holly Juniper never knew she would fall in love with a monster.**

Every winter a mysterious portal appears in her familyâ€™s barn. Nothing has ever come out of it, and she barely pays it any mind. Until a woodland nymph named Nia steps through it and into her life.   
  
Holly is vehemently opposed to her sticking around, not wanting her family play host to a monster, but eventually Nia grows on her in a way she never expected.   
  
Over the course of three months, the two fall in love. Despite them both knowing, come spring, Nia will have to return to her world through the portal, and she can never return.  
  
Book One in the Monster Love Novella series.
