It is a few hours into my [Marjorie Diaz Book 2](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P86KDNM) release party &amp; [Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/wrenzday) and I am excited to say that we are still going strong!

Asking questions, reading chapters, and ultimately failing at video games. [So drop on in](https://www.twitch.tv/wrenzday)! The water’s fine!

While I do all of this, I will be answering questions about myself and [my books](https://desdemonawren.com) and hosting various giveaways.

#### If you tune in and ask questions, you’ll be entered to win a free signed paperback of any of [my books](https://desdemonawren.com/all-books.html). Whichever one you want! It’s gonna be ah-mazing! 

So, tune into [my twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/wrenzday) anytime before to 9pm (PDT) and support me!

Also, if you can: consider [buying me a Ko-Fi](http://ko-fi.com/desdemonawren) to help me through this 6 hour stream.
