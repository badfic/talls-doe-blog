So I’m trying to get everything updated. Everything I haven’t updated for awhile. I might just call Unfaithful finished. I like the way it ended and inspiration is few and far between. If you don’t already know I’m grounded from the internet. It’s also my birthday today so yay me 8D.

This if for thiscoffeeshop and mandydoesntknow (Mandy-whose birthday is the day before mine) and the DACE girls (who have been an amazing support!) And to everyone who has reviewed! You guys are the best!

Even Better

Chapter Five

BEGIN&amp;&amp;

Two hours before the ball and he didn’t have a date. Not that he had been looking, he *wanted* to go with Macy but she was preoccupied with kissing his older brother and being generally adorable. She was distracting him. Which, in hindsight, was probably why he didn’t bother looking for a date. He was certain the search would be *much better* if he didn’t have a certain adorable sporty brunette to worry about. It might’ve been even *easier* to find a date if she didn’t spend every *waking* moment as his house, curled up on his couch…nestled snugly against his *stupid* older brother. Jealousy was a funny thing.

The past few weeks had been awful, terrible, incredibly tough. Not just because Macy was at his house all the time, but because she and Stella thought it would be *fun* to drag him along on shopping trips to shop for dress fabric or whatever. He wasn’t into it and that’s what he tried telling them, but Stella *insisted*. And you *know* how persuasive she can be. Then, when he thought it couldn’t get any *worse*, he still hadn’t found a date! Again, not that he was looking, but it’d be nice to have a date to the “social event of the year” as Stella referred to it.

“Nick!” Stella called from upstairs where she and Macy were getting ready. Joe and Kevin were getting ready in his parents room to give the girls privacy. Nick *should*be changing with his brothers, but instead he’s on dress duty. Which is a lot less awesome than it sounds. He had to make sure nothing went wrong when the girls were changing. Which was kind of a cover for “Nick, we don’t want you in the room with us (since it was smaller than theirs), so go wait on Stella and Macy while we change”. His brothers were delightful.

“Yes, Stella?” He asked, trying to sound, well, not annoyed, but it wasn’t working. Stella ignored his annoyance. Out of the goodness of her heart. Supposedly.

“Come up here and zip me up,” she called and Nick sighed.

“Why can’t Macy do it?” Nick asked. Walking towards the stairs, despite his comment.

“She’s still getting ready,” Stella responded. Nick sighed again, wondering why he knew what she was going to say before she said it. He climbed the stairs, almost dragging his feet. He wasn’t looking forward to helping Stella get ready. Especially since she and Macy had carted him all over heck and creation to look at the things they bought and give his opinion. They knew he was going to just say everything looked “good”, didn’t they? Maybe not.

“Okay, Stella,” he said, reaching the top of the stairs, “I’m here to assist you in getting your dress on.” He lazily made his way towards the blonde who stood in the center of the room.

“About time,” Stella said, holding the dress against her body. Nick sighed a third time, he felt like freaking Cinderella and he wasn’t quite sure why. He stopped walking when he stood close enough behind Stella to grab the top of her dress, holding it together with one hand while with the other he zipped it up. Stella sighed with relief, turning to face him.

“How do I look?” She asked, flashing him a totally Stella smile. Nick withheld a gasp, taking in the intricate designs on her dress. It was stunning. Stella looked gorgeous in white, some pink accessories completing the outfit.

“Fantastic,” he responded, in awe of how she looked. He couldn’t wait to see Joe’s fa-

Macy walked out of the bathroom, a red gown fitting snug against her body, showing off every curve. Nick’s jaw dropped, if Stella looked fantastic, Macy looked incredible, gorgeous, fabulous, amazing, any other adjective to describe her beauty. She smiled at him when she noticed he was there and he felt his heart race. She turned around, showing him the back of the dress where he noticed a short train that began between her back and her rear and went all the way to the floor. Not that he was staring, of course.

“Can you tie this, Nick?” She asked and Nick allowed his eyes to travel upwards to her exposed back and he swallowed. Stella knew how to make a damn good dress.

“Of course,” he responded, that’s what he was there for *right*? He crossed the room and grabbed the ribbon that tied the dress around her neck and tied it in a perfect bow. Then, as he stood back, admiring his work he had an overwhelming urge to reach out and slide his fingers down her back. An urge that he gave into, way before he could stop himself.

Her back was smooth. The skin felt good, *right*, beneath his fingers. She shivered, turning around and staring at him with confused eyes.

“You had something on your back,” he managed to choke out, thoughts going crazy. She smiled at him.

“Thanks for, uh, getting it,” she responded.

“Anytime,” he said. This moment was getting more awkward than he could handle.

“Alright, Nick,” Stella said, clapping her hands together, “thanks for helping us. You can go get ready now. Bye.” She forced him from the room, pushing him towards one of the three fire poles.

“You’re welco-” he began, but Stella shoved him again and he had to grab into the fire pole to save himself from plummeting to his death. Well, sort of to his death. Stella always got a little controlling when she was getting ready for a social event, so he would try not to being up the fact that she very nearly *killed him* anytime in the near future.

END AND BEGIN AGAIN

By the time he had finished getting ready, everyone else had already gone. It was no surprise, Stella was hosting the event and, well, that really only excused Stella and Joe. Not that he was upset that Macy and Kevin had already left. That just made going to the ball alone that much easier. Or did it make it harder? His thoughts were a jumbled mess of emotions and memories of Macy. *A lot* of memories of Macy.

He got into his car, setting his mask in the seat next to him and made his way towards the building where the ball was to be held. This was going to be an interesting night. Nick Lucas arriving stag to the Stella-proclaimed “social event of the year”. Not that they’d know it was him, he would be wearing a mask. Who was he kidding? He was easy to spot. One look at his hair ought to give him away.

He arrived at the building, minutes later, parking his car and making his way towards the entrance. He wasn’t looking forward to this, walking into a ball alone. Not that he wanted to walk into the ball with anyone but Macy on his arm either. Tonight was proving to be rather difficult.

And it didn’t help that he was dressed like a prince without a princess.

Short, I know, but I wanted to at *least* update *something*. And to suburbs and farietaleredux, you guys are amazing writers. I can only aspire to be half as amazing as you are. Ohhh. You guys rock!

Hi guys! I’m not dead. How cool is that. I kinda wanted to finish this, even though I have ZERO inspiration at all ever lately. I can’t even write original stuff. Hope this is good enough for you guys.

Even Better

Chapter Six

Begin&amp;&amp;

When Nick opened the door, walking into the front lobby of the building, the first thing he noticed were the intricate decorations. This was no doubt a Stella event, he could tell from how beautiful and just perfect everything looked. He smirked to himself, despite the intense heartache and loneliness he felt entering this building so full of beauty with no Macy to make this worthwhile.

He stood outside the lobby door for a good minute, talking himself in to walking inside. He really didn’t want to, it was one thing to arrive single with a group of friends, but arriving stag *alone*? He mentally cursed Stella, Joe and Kevin for making him come, for making *sure* that JONAS played a show tonight. This was heart wrenching for him. Thinking about how his stupid brother didn’t even *notice* his infatuation with Macy. How *could* he?

Nick sighed, pacing the floor. That wasn’t fair, was it? It honestly just wasn’t fair for him to think of Kevin so negatively. His brother obviously didn’t know of his feelings for Macy because *Macy* didn’t even know of his feelings for Macy. Nick wasn’t even sure *he* knew for certain until Kevin showed an interest to Macy’s interest. Why did his life have to be so confusing?

From inside Nick’s pant pocket, his cell phone began to ring. His ringtone was old fashioned this week, an antique telephone ring. Or as antique as it could get on a smart phone. He pulled his phone out of his pocket and looked at the caller ID. It was Stella. Of *course* it was Stella because according to the clock, he was 5 minutes late for JONAS’s performance.

“Hello…Stella I…?” Nick asked, bracing himself for the yelling, the screaming, the clawing, the…

“Nick?” Nick froze when he heard her voice. *Macy’s* voice.

“Macy…I…Uh…” He stuttered.

“Nick we’re all really worried…why haven’t you arrived yet? You’re never late for a show. We expect that from Joe, but…” Macy’s voice trails off and Nick’s heart throbs in his chest.

“Macy I’m…I…I…wasn’t…” Nick can’t even get a word out, he’s so tongue tied. So instead he slips inside the door to the ballroom, hanging up his phone and putting it back into his pocket. He doesn’t want to sing, he doesn’t want to play an instrument…not tonight. He’s not even sure if he can, not with the way he feels. Not with the things he’s thinking about Macy.

“I think he hung up,” he hears someone say and he turns and sees her standing there in that breathtaking backless red gown. He can’t even breathe as he watches her pass a phone back to Stella.

*Oh my God*, he thinks, heart racing, palms sweating…*Macy….*

“Great,” Stella says, stomping her foot. Now where are the other two knuckleheads?” Macy shrugs, looking out into the crowd.

“It doesn’t help that every single guy here looks the same, Stel,” Macy remarks, and Stella huffs.

“Just go find your boyfriend and let me deal with Joe.” Macy blushes when Stella refers to Kevin as her *boyfriend* because she hadn’t ever really called him that herself. But, that’s what he was, right? Her *boyfriend*.

“Okay,” she responds and Nick feels a twinge in his heart and a lump in his throat. Her *boyfriend*.

“Kevin?” Macy calls out questioningly into the crowd, but no one answers her, “KEEEVVVIIIN?” she calls again, way louder this time. His brother would’ve had to have been deaf not to he—

“There you are!” Macy says, grabbing *his* arm, “Couldn’t you hear me, Kev?”

“I-I…” Nick stammers. Macy smiles up at him and squeezes his bicep.

“It is really loud in here,” Macy comments, having to shout a little over the music the DJ was playing and the chatter all around them.

“Y…yeah,” Nick says, voice cracking and Macy giggles. He can’t even process what’s happening, just that her touch is…so…he sighs and smiles at her.

“C’mon,” Macy says, “let’s go see if Stella found Joe and then I guess we can try Nick again since he’s still not here.” Macy grabs his hand and chews her lip.

“O..oh” Nick responds.

“Something’s been up with him lately, y’know? He seems so distant from all of us. I don’t understand what changed.” Nick’s heart is thundering in his chest now and he feels uncomfortable listening to Macy talk about him…she thinks she’s talking to Kevin. This isn’t right.

“M…macy…can…” Nick tries, but his stomach is in knots, his voice is too high pitched and doesn’t sound natural, and he just…can’t.

“Wow, Kev, you don’t sound too good…is your voice going? Stella is going to have a conniption!” She leads him backstage and glances around, Stella and the other boys aren’t back yet. Nick’s stomach lurches.

“Oh,” Macy says, “I guess she hasn’t found them…uh,” she glances around again, confused before saying “Ohhh well, guess we’ll just…wait here…” and leaning into him a little bit, smirking up at him and gazing into his brown eyes through his mask. Nick can’t even breathe.
