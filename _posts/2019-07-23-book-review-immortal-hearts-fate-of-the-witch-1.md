***Let me preface my review with this:** I did not like this book. Like It was a struggle for me to read and it turned me off to reading other stuff for a bit, but that doesn’t mean you won’t like it. The romance was very heavy-handed and that didn’t jive well with me, but if you’re into romance then full speed ahead. You’ll probably like this.*

The beginning of the book was a little rocky, to be honest. Moon introduces a bunch of characters in the prologue and I got really confused because she never mentioned who they were to Rainelle, instead she just casually name drops them like I’m supposed to already know who they are. I didn’t. At first, I thought it was because I wasn’t reading the first in the series, but no I definitely was. So, maybe change that up a little?

Like what were the wolves motivations other than power? I know power is a really good motivator, but to be honest, at times this feud seemed really personal so the whole “power” story kind of fell flat to me.

Also, Reed’s whole destiny really upset me. Reed was honestly my favorite character. I liked him more than Rainelle which is weird since I usually prefer the female MC to literally anyone else. However, Rainelle came across as really whiny to me at times. Other times, of course, she was totally badass.

Just at any given second, anyone could pull out a metric butt-ton of guns that was a pretty incredible thing. Yet it’s rare that anyone used their guns which was kind of a bummer.

I have to say I was not a fan of the Rainelle/Samuel romance. It went really fast and he pretty much immediately wanted to marry her right after she got out of a long and abusive relationship with her ex. I was like Samuel calm DOWN. Then Rainelle was also interested in literally every other guy in the book, including an immortal sheriff who was just really creepy to me.

I liked the magicky parts and the betrayal/murder plot a whole lot more than the romance, but I’ve never been a huge romance fan. Great work, Raven Moon. Can’t wait to read the next one.
