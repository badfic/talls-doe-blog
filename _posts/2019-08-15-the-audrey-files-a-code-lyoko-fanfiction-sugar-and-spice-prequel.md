So I wrote a prequel to Sugar and Spice cause I got flamed super bad for that story by a lot of people on the interwebs and the prequel is even worse than the one shot, but I’m sure that’s what you’re all here for so. Enjoy.

**The Audrey Files**

**Chapter One**

- - - - - -

**Disclaimer:***Said it once, and I’ll say it again…I don’t own Code: Lyoko, but I do one Audrey DeBose, and Yes…steal her and I will find a way to find you. WITH MY CHUCKIE DOLL OF DOOOOOM!*

- - - - - -

**Summary:** *Kind of a prequel to Sugar and Spice. Someone new shows up, but she’s pretty quiet…rumors are spread, which interests a certain someone. JxOC OxA YxU*

**A/N:** *Yeah, a lot of you asked who Audrey was…this is explaining if to you. And a little treat! I’ll reply to my reviewers! )*

“Dreaming”

She leaned against the wall, she felt the dizziness take over her. She was afraid, despite the fact she knew exactly what was going to happen. Her breathing got shallow and she fell over and onto the ground.

“Ugh,” she groaned softly, trying to get back up before anyone noticed she was having trouble. She always hated moving, it made her attacks come back, but because of her mother’s choice of a career, she had to move, and often. Finally, she managed to push herself to her feet, moving her red hair back behind her ears. She stared at the schools grounds and checked her schedule, today was going to be fun.

Moments later she entered the schools gates, looking around and hoping to find her classes. Whispers erupted around her, she groaned. This was one of the major reasons she despised moving around, everyone always spread rumors about her. Last time there were rumors about her being a prostitute, just because of the way she dressed. She thought that was totally unfair, other people dressed in less than she did and no one called them a prostitute. Out of the corner of her eye she saw someone staring at her with great intensity, she cocked her head to the side and approached him.

“Hi…” she said softly. He only nodded, acknowledging her presence. She smiled. “Can you tell me how to get here?” She pointed to a something on the paper she held in her hands. He leaned over the paper, staring at it. She could feel his breath on her neck and she blushed, no guy had ever gotten this close to her before.

“No, I’m sorry…I can’t, but I’m sure my friend Yumi can,” he explained.

“Where can I find this ‘Yumi’?” she asked. The guy looked at her and chuckled lightly.

“Well, you can find her in the class you just pointed out to me, so I don’t know how helpful I am.” The girl groaned.

“So tell me, should I just wait till it’s over, or brave it on my own?”

“You could go to the principal,” he offered. She laughed lightly and shook her head.

“I’d rather die.” The guy laughed.

“Come on, he’s not that bad…he might get onto you about your clothing though.”

“What’s wrong with the way I dress?”

“In my opinion, nothing, but in his opinion…it would be a little to revealing. Although his daughter, Sissi, wears a lot less clothing than you do.”

“So he shouldn’t bother me on my clothing then should he?”

“No, I guess not…”

“So where do I find this principal?”

“Um…why don’t I just walk you?”

“That sounds like a good idea.” The guy lead her down the random hallways of the school and it reminded her of a maze, the kind of maze you never made it out of alive.

“So…” the guy said slowly, letting her know he was uncomfortable with her being silent. She laughed a little.

“My name is Audrey DeBose,” she said, trying to make small talk.

“Ulrich,” the guy said calmly. Audrey just nodded, and they kept on walking.

Soon the pair stopped in front of a beautifully engraved door and Ulrich opened it for her. She smiled in thanks and entered. A secretary looked up at her.

“May I help you?” She asked calmly.

“Yes, I’m a new student…” Audrey said, her voice trailing off. Suddenly she felt shy under the secretary’s cold unfeeling gaze.

“Take a seat; he will be right with you.” Audrey smiled weakly, pushing her red hair behind her ears once more before sitting down in a brown leather chair. She looked around the room at the off white colored walls and the pale blue carpeting. It made her shiver; even if the room wasn’t cold it felt cold. It felt cold because it was so empty, all that was in there was the secretary’s smooth wooden desk and a few fake plants. Other than that there was nothing, the secretary didn’t even have pictures on her desk, but it was filled to the maximum with paperwork and notepads.

From inside the other room Audrey could hear an argument going on between the principal and some other student. At her last school she wasn’t allowed to argue with her principal, every time she tried her parents would scold her and she would be grounded for a very long time. Like it mattered anyway, she never made any friends, and even when she did her mother usually got relocated afterwards. So these days she just didn’t socialize at all, because then when she left…she wouldn’t have to tell her friends good-bye. Good-bye was the most painful thing for her, she couldn’t stand saying it, because everyone was in tears and it just hurt so badly.

The door to the office swung open and a girl with black hair waked out, looking extremely upset. She was wearing a mid-drift shirt and an extremely short skirt, Audrey assumed that this was the daughter. The girl’s mouth curled into a smirk.

“Look what the cat dragged in,” she said snobbishly, tilting her head back and laughing. Audrey just stared at her, thinking of how fortunate she was not to know this person.

“Oh,” said the man behind her, “You must be Audrey DeBose.” Audrey nodded, and the girl’s mouth dropped.

“The Audrey DeBose?” She asked, as if she were unable to hold in her excitement.

“Uh, yeah…” Audrey said. It was funny how her name could change people’s minds about her.

“Oh my gosh!” She squealed, jumping up and down. The principal just stared at her, sighing before allowing Audrey to enter and shutting the door on the overexcited student on the outside.

“You’ll have to excuse my daughter; she’s a big fan.”

“Perfectly understandable,” Audrey said, a little taken aback by the tone of voice she said it in.

“Now,” he said, “Down to business, I’d like to welcome you to our humble school, and I will give you a dorm as soon as I can, unless you would like to stay at home?”

“I’d like a dorm; home is too far for me to get to, besides like my mom needs me home anyway.” Audrey smiled sweetly and the principal went on.

“All right,” he said, “I assume you have your schedule?

“Yes, of course,” Audrey said, “but I’m going to need someone to help me to my classes until I get the hand of things.”

“Of course, let me see your schedule…” She handed him he schedule and he looked over it.

“Ah yes, you and Ms. Yumi would get along famously, you’re in all of her classes.” Audrey just nodded. “I’ll call her to the office now.” He pressed a button on his speaker phone.

“Alice?” He asked the woman outside in the other room.

“Yes?” Came her dull, lifeless reply.

“Could you call Yumi Ishiyama to the office please?”

“Of course, just one moment please.”

Audrey heard the soft buzzing of the intercom and then she heard the secretary say Yumi’s name.

“Yumi Ishiyama please report to the principal’s office, Yumi Ishiyama to the office.”

- - - - - -

Yumi glared at the intercom and groaned. What did that old man want her for this time? She hadn’t done anything wrong, she knew that. The class ooed and awed around her, she ignored them; opening the door and walking off down the hallway.

Soon after she left her last class, she entered the principal’s office, the secretary nodded to her and she entered the room.

“Ah, Yumi,” the principal said calmly. Yumi glared at him, then she noticed the girl sitting in the chair before his desk, she eyed her suspiciously.

“You look familiar,” Yumi said, finally. Audrey just laughed a little.

“I’m sorry,” she said. Yumi laughed, this girl was funny.

“Do anyway, why did you call me up here?” She asked the principal.

“Oh, yes, Audrey is new and she needs someone to show her around a bit.”

“All right, sounds fun,” Yumi said turning back to her, “You ready Audrey?” Audrey nodded in reply and Yumi led her out of the room and into the hallway.

“So…what class do you have now?” Audrey asked, just as the bell rang.

“Well, I did have Science, but you know, that’s the bell,” Yumi said with a laugh.

“What now?” Audrey asked. Yumi sped up a little, Audrey matched her pace.

“Now, I get to introduce you to my friends,” Yumi said, opening a door, and both of them exited the building.

“Hey, Jeremie,” Yumi said. Jeremie waved to her and looked up briefly, not even noticing Audrey. She smiled, that was just the way she liked it, she wasn’t famous around here, no, she was invisible.

“You know where the others are?” Yumi asked. Jeremie looked up again, finally noticing Audrey was there.

“No…” He said, his voice trailed off as he met Audrey’s eyes. She beamed and waved to him. “Who is this?”

“What?” Yumi asked, remembering Audrey was next to her, “Oh, her?” Yumi pointed and Jeremie nodded smartly.

“Yes, her,” he said with a smirk and a wink in Audrey’s direction.

“This is our new 9th grader, Audrey DeBose,” Yumi said, presenting her name as if she were a star. Jeremie gave her a warm smile and she smiled back, so happy that no one knew who she was besides Sissi.

“Hello!” A cheerful voice came, making Audrey jump a little. She turned to see a short blonde haired kid. She twitched uncomfortably.

“There you are Odd, have you seen Ulrich?” Yumi asked. Odd shook his head and eyed Audrey. Then he leaned over to whisper something to Jeremie.

“You know, she’s kind of cute Jeremie, how do you know her?”

“I don’t,” Jeremie whispered back, simply.

“You again,” Ulrich said as her approached the group. Audrey gave him a smile.

“Do I disappoint you?” She asked coolly. Ulrich just laughed and shook his head.

“Of course not, I was just a little surprised.”

“Oh,” Audrey said, rolling her eyes at him. Ulrich crossed his arms; obviously he was a little upset. Yumi giggled under her breath, making sure Ulrich wouldn’t hear her.

“Hey guys,” Aelita said, taking her place beside Jeremie. Everyone in the circle waved, “Uh, who is this?” She asked motioning to Audrey.

“This is Audrey DeBose,” Yumi said. Aelita’s jaw dropped, and she hugged Audrey.

“The Audrey DeBose?” She squealed happily. Audrey sighed and nodded.

“Uh…who is Audrey DeBose?” Odd and Ulrich asked in unison.

“Only the best—”Aelita started, Audrey silenced her.

“Audrey DeBose, is who I am, I’d prefer if you know no more than that,” Audrey said, giving Aelita a look of pure loathing. Aelita looked down at the ground, kicking some dirt with her shoe. Then, Sissi showed up with a big grin on her face.

“Speak of the devil,” Audrey mumbled.

“Hey Audrey, what are you doing hanging out with these losers when you could be hanging out with me?” Audrey looked up at her and smirked.

“Because, Sissi, these ‘losers’ as you call them, are so much better than you’ll ever be,” Audrey smirked at her. Sissi smirked back, and Audrey looked at her quizzically.

“Oh, Audrey, you silly,” Sissi said, leaning in and whispering, “you want the whole school to know what you really are?” Audrey glared at her.

“What am I really Sissy?” Audrey spat, “Some famous child singer that no one remembers, an actress, a *whore*?” Sissy growled.

“Well, I’d say none of the above, with the way you dress you look like a tramp.” Audrey smirked, she had her right were she wanted her.

“Well, Sissi dear, you wear much less than I do, so what does that make you?” Sissi scoffed and stormed off.

“Singer?” Ulrich asked.

“A part of my past I’d rather not talk about,” Audrey commented. The rest of them just shrugged and the group got quiet. What was this Audrey girl trying to hide exactly?
