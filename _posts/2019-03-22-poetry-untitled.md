I still remember the exact moment I fell in love with you  
the very instance.  
the way you were standing  
face contorted in deep thought  
lips pursed, hands holding a guitar.

I can remember every detail  
from the stubble on your face to  
the color—  
 the style of your jeans  
the color of the laces in your shoes.

I remember how your eyes  
held my image with contempt  
staring at me blankly and wondering  
who I was and  
why I was there.

I remember smiling  
because that’s all you ever make me do  
smile.  
even as I lay here  
broken &amp; alone  
the thought of your laugh  
the way you wrinkle your nose  
your lopsided grin  
makes me smile

because I can’t stop loving you.
