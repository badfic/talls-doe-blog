It was a cold winter’s night and Sam was walking the streets alone. She had a fight with her mother about what she was wearing a few hours earlier so she didn’t want to go home just yet.

In her eyes her mother had no right to tell her what to do, she was almost eighteen and she wasn’t going to put up with her constant bickering anymore. If her grandmother could accept her then why couldn’t her parents?

She stared at the building in front of her. It was the Fenton’s house the only place she would ever really feel at home. She hadn’t realized that’s where she was walking to, but talking to Danny wouldn’t hurt.

She checked her watch and it read six in the evening. She decided it would be fine for her to visit…it wasn’t too early, but it was late enough for her to be able to visit without any of those pesky questions.

Upstairs in his room Danny paced the floor nervously.

“Sam,” he said into his mirror, “I’ve been waiting for a long time to tell you this…I um…I…” Danny struggled to get out as a blush covered his cheeks.

“You what?” Sam asked, pushing open the door. Danny’s eyes widened, had she been listening the whole time?

“How long have you—” Danny started, but was interrupted by Sam finishing his sentence, “Standing here?” She asked, running her fingers through her hair, and receiving a nod from Danny, “Long enough to hear you mess up on whatever you’re trying to tell me.”

Danny sighed with relief.

“What was that exactly?” She asked, noticing something glittering on the floor. She entered the room slowly and shut the door behind her.

“What was what?” Danny asked, trying to play dumb as Sam crouched down and picked up a small blue ring from the floor.

“What you wanted to tell me,” she said, inspecting the ring. Danny laughed nervously and began to sweat slightly from his forehead when he noticed what ring that was.

“N-nothing,” he managed, walking across the room and trying to take the ring from her.

“Oh no you don’t,” Sam said playfully, turning from him and holding in up into the light, “It has my name inside of it…did you get this for me?” Danny froze.

“Uh…no…it belongs to my…um…” Danny tried to say, but Sam stopped him.

“Don’t lie to me Danny,” Sam said, walking past him to sit on his bed, “Why would you buy me something like this?”

“Well, uh, because…” Danny said stumbling over his words, “I-it’s…a promise ring…yeah,” he was gaining more confidence, “a promise ring.”

“What kind of promise?” Sam asked slipping the ring on her left ring finger and holding her hand up to examine how it looked.

Danny kicked the floor slightly with his shoe, stirring up a little bit of dust. The room fell into silence as Danny stood there shyly and Sam examined the ring on her finger.

“Well?” Sam asked, letting her hand fall down next to her side. Danny looked at her with an emotion she had never seen in his eyes before. He came closer to her.

“Sammy, we’re almost eighteen and I just…I wanted you to know that if you…can’t,” he paused to regain his composure before blurting out “I love you.”

Sam gasped and stood up to hug him, but he surprised her with a kiss.

“I love you too Danny Fenton,” she whispered from the warmth of his embrace, “but I have one question…”

“What’s that?” Danny asked, pulling back from her and holding her at arms length.

“What the hell took you so long?”

Danny smirked and pulled Sam close to him once more, planting a kiss upon her lips.

“I don’t know Sam,” Danny said, resting his chin on the top of her head. Sam smiled against his chest, listening to his heart beat in time with hers.

A promise of love was made on a cold winter’s night. A promise made with a blue ring and sealed with a kiss.
