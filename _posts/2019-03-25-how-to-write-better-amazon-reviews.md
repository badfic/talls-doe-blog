Hey guys! Recently I’ve run into a lot of people asking me how to write better reviews on Amazon for books they’ve read from fellow indie authors.

But the thing about reviewing books is, unless you’re running a review blog, you don’t have to do much!

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.desdemonawren.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tew9h80.gif?resize=500%2C375&ssl=1)</figure></div>My reviews are long and wordy because I’ve got a lot to say (plus I write reviews for books here on my blog as well, so I like to try and sell those books to my readers).

But if you’re not doing that, here’s my easy-peasy **four-step process for writing Amazon reviews (and getting them approved by the powers that be)**:

 **1**. Don’t use any profanity (Amazon won’t publish foul language)

**2**. Abide by that ridiculous [$50 purchase rule ](https://the-digital-reader.com/2017/12/10/new-rule-spent-50-minimum-post-review-amazon/)(it sucks, I know)

**3**. Cross-post your reviews to [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) (it seriously helps!)

**4**. A little goes a long way! Your review doesn’t have to be a novel. A few sentences would be just fine. Leave the writing to the authors, just make sure they know how much you appreciate their hard work!

If you don’t know what to write, a simple “This was really good! I can’t wait to read more by *Author name*” will suffice.

Or, if you didn’t like the book, feel free to give constructive criticism. I personally read every review I get to try and improve my work. Some of them can be really harsh, so try not to outright attack the author, but be sure to point out anything problematic so they can fix it in the future.

That’s all it takes. Reviews aren’t rocket science and it’s something really easy and really nice you can do to help an author you admire to succeed in the market.
