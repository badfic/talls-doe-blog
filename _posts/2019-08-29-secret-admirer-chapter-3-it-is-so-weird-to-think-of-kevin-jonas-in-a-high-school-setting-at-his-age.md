Secret Admirer

Disclaimer:*I do not own JONAS.*

Author’s notes:*I’m so glad that everyone likes this story! I just want to say a quick thank you to all my reviewers! I’m so, so, so, so, so glad that you guys are dying to know who is leaving the notes for Macy. Solitaire42 asked if you guys were ever going to be able to read the notes. I don’t know. Maybe at the end. What do you guys want?*

. . . . . . . .

Macy woke up in one of the beds of the school infirmary. After a few moments of staring at the ceiling and wondering why she always had to faint when she got anywhere near a JONAS, she sat up, looking around the room.

She noticed that the nurse was talking to another student, so she decided to go ahead and get up to leave.

“Honestly, Kevin,” the nurse said, “how you managed to do this is beyond me.” Macy stopped and peeked around the curtain. Sure enough there was Kevin Lucas of JONAS sitting on one of the exam tables, getting thorns plucked out of his hand.

“Hey Macy!” Kevin said, with a smile when he noticed her. She reminded herself to take a deep breath. Once that was out of the way, she stepped out from behind the curtain and waved kind of shyly. Something about being in the infirmary with Kevin Lucas calmed her excitedly obsessed fan girl spirit.

“Are you alright now, Ms. Misa?” The nurse asked her.

“Yes ma’am,” she said, “can I go back to class now?” The nurse chuckled.

“You just missed your last class,” she informed her, “the bell rang about ten minutes ago.” Macy swallowed.

“How long have I been passed out?” She asked. The nurse checked her watch.

“About an hour,” she responded, “you’re welcome to le-” she began, but Macy didn’t stick around for the rest of her sentence. She bolted from the room and made her way to her locker. She had to know who was leaving the notes.

When she got there, she found Stella standing next to her locker, examining the single red rose that was taped to the door. Macy gasped, walking quickly down the hallway to claim her rose.

“That guy must really be into you,” Stella said when she noticed her friend approaching. Macy smiled, un-taping the rose from her locker door gently, careful not to let any of the thorns prick her. Then she did the combination and watched as another folded over piece of green paper fell at her feet.

She picked it up and read it over, her lips curling into a smile. When she had finished her turned to look at Stella.

“I’ve got to find out who this guy is,” she said, a look of sheer determination on her face. Stella nodded in agreement.

“I want to know just as bad as you do, Mace,” she said.

“That’s a pretty rose,” Kevin said from up the hallway, just having left the nurses office.

“What happened to you?” Stella asked, motioning to his bandaged hand.

“Got a couple thorns stuck in my hand,” he said. Stella and Macy exchanged glances.

“How?” Macy asked, looking down at her rose.

“Lab in Biology,” Kevin responded, “who knew thorny bushes had thorns?” Macy smiled and laughed. Kevin smiled too.

“They’re supposed to,” Macy said with a giggle, “that’s why they call them thorny bushes.”

“What kind of lab were you doing with thorny bushes?” Stella asked, wondering if that was even a real bush.

“I don’t know,” Kevin said, holding up his hand, “I left a few minutes in. I hope my lab partner had an easier time than I did.” Macy laughed again. It was so easy for her to be herself around Kevin. Even if he was, in her eyes, the most attractive member of JONAS. Stella narrowed her eyes at him and plucked the green paper out of Macy’s hand,

“Do you know anything about this, Kev?” Stella asked, handing the note to him. Kevin took it and opened it.

“Wait!” Macy said, snatching it from him, “don’t read it.”

“He wrote it, Mace,” Stella said. Both Kevin and Macy turned to her, eyes wide.

“No I didn’t,” Kevin said, his voice even. Macy pointed at him.

“His voice didn’t squeak, Stella,” Macy said, “he didn’t write it.” Stella narrowed her eyes at him again. She couldn’t deny that Macy was right, his voice had remained even, but the thorns he had gotten stuck in his hand due to some kind of thorny bush incident was suspicious.

It was obvious that Kevin liked her, anyways. The was he was looking down at her now, probably checking her out. Ever since that whole Macy singing backup catastrophe, Kevin had been looking at her in a different light. Not to mention, Macy had been a lot calmer around him than she was around his brothers.

“Fine,” Stella said.

“What’s it say?” Kevin asked, motioning to the green piece of paper Macy held. She smiled up at him awkwardly. Kevin almost frowned. She was using her fan girl smile again.

“Nothing,” she said, sort of breathlessly. Normal Macy was fun while she lasted, but most of their conversations ended with her going back to weird fan girl Macy. Or fainting. Fainting seemed to be very popular.

“Macy has a secret admirer,” Stella explained. Kevin looked from Macy to Stella, his forehead crinkling in confusion.

“That’s cool,” he said, offering a smile even though he looked crushed. Stella pursed her lips. Could her admirer really be the oldest Lucas brother when he looked like, well, that upon finding out what the note was? “Is the rose from him too?” He asked.

“Yep,” Macy said, smiling at the rose.

“Oh,” Kevin said. Stella continued to watch him. Even when Macy checked her watch and gasped.

“Oh no!” She said. Both Stella and Kevin looked down at her. “I’m late for soccer!” She said, grabbing her gear out of her still open locker, slamming it closed and taking off down the hallway. When she was out of sight, Stella approached Kevin.

“Tell me the truth, Lucas,” she said, poking her index finger into his chest, “are you her secret admirer?” Kevin looked at her, eyes wide. He swallowed nervously.

Ending Notes:*Cliffhanger. Kind of. I wanted her to have a moment with Kevin, but I guess her staying calm was enough of a moment. For now.*
