**Secret Oblivion**

**-Chapter Nine-**

**Disclaimer:** I own not Harry Potter, but own I do the OC: Hannah Pettigrew. My friend owns the OC that will come along later. (OC used with permission)

**Summary:** When Hannah becomes a death eater she peers into her future to see what will become of her life. When she sees Sirius become hurt, she vows to never let that happen, but will she remember the images in time to save everyone? SB/OC SS/OC JP/LP

**A/N:** Time to try and fix a few things. I never intended her to go back to Sirius, so time to have a little fun.

“Your Eyes Open”

Hannah sighed, she had no intention of actually meeting Sirius, and she suspected it to be a trick, so she went back to Snape. She knocked on the door gently and Snape opened it.

“Hannah,” Snape said. He seemed a little surprised. She hugged him, and he invited her into the house.

“Sirius called me…” She said softly. Snape looked at her, expecting more of the story.

“And?” He asked pushing her on.

“He wanted…um to meet me he said he was sorry, but I don’t believe it Snape…” Snape gave her a reassuring smile and put his hand on her shoulder.

“So you came back here? Why?”

“I don’t believe him, I think it’s a trick…I don’t need that right now.”

“Why do you think it’s a trick?”

“He saw my mark Snape, I told you that!” Snape drew back from her.

“Hannah! Hannah no need to get angry…” Hannah let out a long drawn out sigh and stared at him. He could tell she was about to cry. He could see the tears shimmering on the brim of her eye it was like a dam was about to break on a defenseless city. His similes scared him.

“I’m not angry,” She said pathetically. The tears broke the dam and fell from her eyes. She shook with anger and Snape was afraid to touch her. He stood motionless as she tried in every attempt to stop her tears from falling. Snape didn’t dare utter a word; she had to settle this for herself. Her breathing got sharper, but he didn’t bother asking her if she was okay.

After awhile she stared up at Snape, tears were still falling, but hate had formed in her eyes. It was an unforgivable hate. She still shook with anger; it was magnifying the effect. He took an involuntary step back and gulped. He didn’t understand why he had to be afraid of her.

“*You don’t have to be afraid of her Snape,”* His mind shot back at him. Oh yes he did. He wasn’t as strong as she was. Wait? Why did he think this? He had never gone up against Hannah in hand to hand combat! How did he know if she was stronger or if he was? Maybe she just was stronger than he was. Maybe there was never a doubt in his mind.

His mind started screaming at him to draw his wand, but he couldn’t, not on Hannah. She was his friend when no one else was. She made him smile when he was depressed. Needless to say, she had been his angel countless times.

“Hannah…” He spoke softly. She stared at him; the hatred was still present in her eyes. “Open your eyes Hannah…”

Sirius took a seat and looked out for Hannah for what seemed like decades. She wasn’t coming he was sure of it. Somehow he regretted calling. He didn’t want to have anything to do with a Death eater. Maybe he had been hard on her about that, but he had to be didn’t he? She had started following *he-who-must-not-be-named.* That was unforgivable wasn’t it?

“So, Mr. Black,” The bartender said. He sighed without looking up. He waved his hand, the bartender smiled. “You sure Mr. Black?”

“Yes, I’m sure. The regular is fine now just do your job.”

“Jeez, Mr. Black, you don’t have tah be so rude!” Sirius only rolled his eyes and went back to what he was doing.

Soon someone sat across from him; he looked up to see some random woman. She smiled at him. Her lips were painted a brilliant red and she was wearing some revealing clothing. Sirius raised his eyebrow and a laugh tickled his throat.

“The town whore I presume?” He asked curtly. She narrowed her eyes at him, but she still didn’t leave.

“I am not the town whore,” she protested weakly. Sirius rolled his eyes and tried to wave her off. She didn’t leave.

“Go, I’m waiting for someone!” He waved his hand seriously and she laughed, leaning across the table and placing her head in her hands.

“You’ve been waitin’ for her all night Mr. Black.”

“My, my, aren’t we little miss observant?” The woman rolled her eyes, but still stayed in the same position. Anyone who wasn’t Sirius could see she was trying to get him to look down her shirt. Sirius wasn’t interested. The woman raised her eyebrow and sighed.

“I guess so,” she said dully, drawing back off the table and sitting up straight in the chair. She stood and left, going back to the bar. Sirius was relieved to see her go. She was very bothersome. He tapped his fingers impatiently on the table, and the bartender brought him his drink. He sighed heavily, took a few sips then flung the money on the table and left. He couldn’t stand being there without Hannah. She had always made him laugh, since there first year at Hogwarts. Now everything just seemed so far away, they seemed worlds apart.

He laughed remembering one of their best times at Hogwarts…

*It had been around Christmas time and neither him nor Hannah were going home that year. Since they were in different houses they usually had to sneak out to see each other. One night, Sirius took James, who has also stayed for the long break, and his invisibility cloak to see Hannah.*

“*Why don’t you just tell her you like her?” James whispered harshly into Sirius’ ear.*

“*Hannah is my friend,” Sirius protested firmly. James sighed and has been about to say more before they tripped on something.*

“*Watch yourselves boys,” Hannah had told them with a smart wink. They both only laughed and took of the cloak. That night they had talked for hours on end about nothing in particular, but after James had fallen asleep in the grass on the grounds Hannah and Sirius had gotten closer to beat the cold. It was the first time he had slept next to her like that, and it was also the first time he kissed her.*

He shook the memories from his head, got up and left. He sighed; he kept walking farther and farther into the wizarding world. Until he stood on a bridge and he looked out over the water. He sighed at its calmness and tried to shake Hannah’s face out of his mind. He couldn’t take this!

Soft drizzle started to fall from the sky, Sirius didn’t move at all. He liked the rain for the most part. He was kind of glad it wasn’t worse…yet. He sighed shaking his head again. He turned his face up to the sky as the rain started to fall harder. He smiled widely and laughed. Memories filled his mind again and he did nothing to stop them. Not like he could stop them anyway.

Snape put his hand on Hannah’s shoulder, but she shook it off and glared at him.

“Now, now Hannah…just listen…open your eyes.” She growled at him hatefully and made a move for her wand, he drew his and was about to shout something when Hannah stupefied him.

“Get used to feeling defenseless Snape,” Hannah said in a voice that was not her own. He let out a gasp. She had been taken over, but by whom? He watched her run off, thrusting her wand in her pocket. He silently prayed for the spell to wear off of him.

Well it’s a lonely road that you have chosen

Morning comes and you don’t want to know me anymore

And it’s a long time since your heart was frozen

Morning comes and you don’t want to know me anymore

For a moment your eyes open and you know

All the things I ever wanted you to know

I don’t know you, and I don’t want to

Till the moment your eyes open and you know

That it’s a lonely place that you have run to

Morning comes and you don’t want to know me anymore

And it’s a lonely end that you will come to

Morning comes and you don’t want to know me anymore

For a moment your eyes open and you know

All the things I ever wanted you to know

I don’t know you, and I don’t want to

Till the moment your eyes open and you know

For a moment your eyes open and you know

All the things I ever wanted you to know

I don’t know you, and I don’t want to

Till the moment your eyes open and you know

-Keane-Your eyes open—

2019 Des talking now: This concludes Secret Oblivion. It was abandoned after this probably because of my short attention span. Or the fact that it was terrible and old me never edited ANYTHING. I dunno. There’s no outline so I literally don’t even know where this was supposed to go.
