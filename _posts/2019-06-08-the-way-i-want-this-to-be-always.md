It’s been so long, I’d forgotten how good it felt to rest against you like this. I know we’re both crying now, but I can’t help thinking how amazing it feels to have my face resting against your chest and your arm around me.   
  
I can’t explain it, but I want to be here with you…like this forever. It’s comforting to feel this sensation of belonging. Your hand brushes over my hair and down my back and I’ve never felt so much love for you.  
  
The way things are right now, with you smiling down at me, kissing the top of my head and lacing your free hand with the one I placed on your chest…I wouldn’t trade this for the world. I feel the sting of tears being brought forth and a smile coming to my lips.   
  
My thoughts immediately shift to a song from the opera we watched together and I feel the tears roll down from my eyes, down my cheeks and over my lips.   
  
I never knew I’d love you so much, but I do.
