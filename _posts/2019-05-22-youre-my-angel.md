Your lips are smooth against mine  
the gentle feeling of your hands against my back  
holding me with whispers of desire and   
you say “don’t hold back” like you  
want all of my pain to flow through you  
and out of me completely.

You whisper against my neck,   
soft butterfly kisses on my throat   
and I’m gone, pushed under these waves of  
time and it’s running out, but you say…  
“don’t think about it” like you know  
that one day we’ll be infinite.

I’m all broken beneath my flesh   
and constantly anticipating being alone  
but you hold me close like the seconds aren’t   
falling behind and you say “time is on our side”  
as our last moments shatter like crystal  
and all that’s left of me is waiting.

Every second is perfection when you hold me  
tell me “it’s only a little while longer” and I  
realize that no matter what, you’re the only one  
who knows what I need to hear to make me real  
and untie me from the reality I lie to myself in.

&amp; as you slip away  
I say “please don’t go”.
