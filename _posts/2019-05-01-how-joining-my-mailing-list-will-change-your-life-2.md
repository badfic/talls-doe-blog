That’s right fans of Desdemona Wren (me) and queer literature (what myself and most of my friends write) I have an [email newsletter](https://desdemonawren.com/) you can sign up for right now immediately!

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.desdemonawren.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/475fbeec1fda7db8cab87dcfb09e2e81.gif?resize=495%2C278&ssl=1)</figure></div>This means you’ll never miss out on what I’m reading. Or what book I’m writing. [My newsletter](https://desdemonawren.com/) has it all!

#### Here’s 5 ways my [email newsletter](https://desdemonawren.com/) will change your life:

1\. You get to hear from me once a month about what I’m doing  
2\. You get to discover other queer authors in my “What I’m reading section”  
3\. You get sneak peaks for what I’m writing   
4\. You get to see new fanart I haven’t promo’d on my blog yet  
5\. You get the earliest access to ARCs and giveaways!

But if you’re jonesing for some more of my work and want to see all of this more than once a month, you can [support me on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/desdemonawren) where you’ll also get access to my erotic stories, cool comic pages, crack drawings of my characters, and more!

And if Patreon isn’t something you have or you’re not ready for the monthly commitment, you can [buy me a Ko-Fi](http://ko-fi.com/desdemonawren) to show you care.
