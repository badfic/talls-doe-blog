### NSFW Warning

Here we are, continuing on our journey of self-hatred and terror.

Once again with <a>13</a>​ by my side, we will prevail.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/30dbcd2b8fe642ecf0964f6a7db36eb3/tumblr_inline_ouv91mt8AU1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Thirteen:** Man it’d be cool if we had the technology to identify someone before seeing them in person.  
**Thirteen:** Also, what the fuck?  
**Thirteen:** You’re EXPECTING your daughter, and she just totally doesn’t resemble what you remember of her at all?  
**Thirteen:** I think this just stopped being as creepy because this is clearly some other random girl.   
**Me:**  Pretending to be his biological daughter to get a free place to stay.   
**Thirteen:**  Yep. And dick, inevitably. And probably the dildo collection.   
**Thirteen:** His REAL daughter got lost, met a cute girl, and ended up running away with her.   
**Me:** And they all lived gaily ever after.   
**Thirteen:** And far far away from her incestuous pedo dad.

### **Blah blah blah more talking still in the same hallway. Awkward conversation is awkward. Until *FINALLY:***

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/162a02a42e0f1417048b72590d9c0576/tumblr_inline_ouv9876epd1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Thirteen:**  So why is she standing like she had her hip explode anyway?  
**Me:** She’s protecting her hip from attack.   
**Thirteen:**  That’s not the bit you wanna protect hon   
**Thirteen:** It’s a little lower.

### **Blah blah blah Humbert just says the exact same thing like 900 times. She calls him dad, we both die a little on the inside.** 

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/9bb429600f0401b2b5f26393c9e76cf1/tumblr_inline_ouv9efKTLB1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:**  How about: golly gee dad, how come you’re crowding me up against the door and staring at my tits?   
**Thirteen:**  The cartoon bear on her giant tiddies is a nice touch.   
**Me:**  It’s Whinnie the Pedo Trap   
**Me:**  Oh wait that wasn’t Lolita talking this whole time.   
**Me:** That was Humbert.   
**Me:** Haha it’s even in a different color and I should have noticed this and I feel dumb.   
**Thirteen:** Oh I was too busy trying to translate tiddy bear’s heart.   
**Me:**  I was too busy being visually assaulted by bright white and bright red simultaneously.   
**Thirteen:** Yeah this place must be hell to keep clean based on all the fucking bright white. And that was BEFORE she got here. Gods know it’s going to be much filthier now.  
**Thirteen:** Also, I am SO uncomfortable with how short she is. I mean, sure, petite women exist and are great but it’s NOT helping the “she is 12 with a boob job” vibes.  
**Thirteen:** Which I suppose is the point.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/3e80d0ff270977a7639764a079f61f77/tumblr_inline_ouv9nuVSia1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** She pretty much looks exactly like my 13 year old niece is said niece had blonde hair. And giant plastic surgery tits. This is hard to look at, not gonna lie.   
**Thirteen:** Nice that she’s stuck in Sexbot Pose #5 now, thrusting her familial tiddies at us as much as possible.   
**Thirteen:**  Seriously, who holds their arm like that? I just tried and it was not comfortable.  
**Me:**  ow. You’re right

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/3ee1ef9cd8262e4d7dfbde6277adee6f/tumblr_inline_ouv9t19ya41qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** I just wish they would fucking stop talking.   
**Me:**  Every click is more and more of this boring bullshit.   
**Thirteen:** It could be worse.  
**Thirteen:** Just remember that.  
**Thirteen:** Soon you’ll wish for boring.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/311636bafd4bdf23633f1096b2caf185/tumblr_inline_ouva0lcdcF1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Thirteen:** Yes yes you want to jizz all over her pudgy chipmunk face we get it shut up.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/928a31c20c0bd27a7df96b01c3c50ee0/tumblr_inline_ouva3ku7ha1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:**  auggghhh.  
**Thirteen:**  Eeeaaauuughhhh.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/0d3494ed4252d7550b9e75e5a276a3ce/tumblr_inline_ouva5dsv2q1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** Well *fuck* what do we pick?   
**Thirteen:** I mean my choice is “touch her as little as possible”.  
**Thirteen:**  But are we going for “try to do this ‘correctly'”, “intentional sabotage by being as gross as Humbert really is”, or “AVOID INCEST AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE POR FAVOR”?   
**Me:**  We’re going for minimal self-sabotage morbid curiousity while also not trying to be a shitty father.   
**Thirteen:** I’m not sure how to do that, man.  
**Thirteen:** Considering what we have to work with.   
**Me:**  Man I think we should just shake her hand. That seems fatherly.   
**Thirteen:**  He’s so gonna grab her tit.   
**Thirteen:** (Well, probably not, but you know he WANTS to.)   
**Me:** LET’S FIND OUT.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/e1804b75de36a82bf12916240504c81a/tumblr_inline_ouvaeaWBCR1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** I’m pretty sure we got 0 points. We’re the best at this game.   
**Thirteen:** I think someone put her jaw on wrong. It keeps looking weird. Well her lower lip does.   
**Thirteen:**  Is there a “bad” end where we don’t fuck our daughter?  
**Thirteen:** Let’s try for that one.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/89a70d1c170281e72c58279bbdad7c63/tumblr_inline_ouvah5xHZr1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:**  This handshake has gone on too long now.   
**Thirteen:** Watch even seemingly innocuous actions become creepy as fuck through the magic of this…thing!

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/05c9d8f79d7bd383eed99d1ea7d3f219/tumblr_inline_ouvak8Agro1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Thirteen:** Everything occurring here, yes   
**Me:**  Yes.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/edd8c2f8f2f60b0bae353581975eeea5/tumblr_inline_ouvamchGzX1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** WELL YOU’RE SOL LOLITA BECAUSE I’M PUTTING ON DAD CHARM AND DAD-ZONING YOU.   
**Thirteen:** AND IT’S TERRIBLE THAT WE SHOULD EVEN HAVE TO DO THAT BY THE WAY YOU DISGUSTING LITTLE SUCCUBUS.  
**Me:**  PUT YOUR SHORTS BACK ON AND LET’S GO GET SOME ICE CREAM AND WATCH A BALL GAME.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/16dac6f5cfc9fd7b6f1124c8eaa8bf72/tumblr_inline_ouvapzYmVR1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** STOP TRYING TO MAKE SENSE, HUMBERT. I HATE YOU.   
**Thirteen:** “Most people hate physical contact”?????   
**Thirteen:** Here I was under the impression that people who hate physical contact are the outliers.  
**Thirteen:** Wow I’m normal  
**Thirteen:** Who knew  
**Thirteen:** (Not me)   
**Me:** I mean. Okay, but. Listen, if I was a person who enjoyed physical contact. Which I’m not. But if I was, I would basically be like “NOT YOU HUMBERT. NOT. YOU.” And just tell him I hate physical contact. Though, at 27, I doubt I’m his type.   
**Thirteen:**  LOL Okay fine, I guess he does have a skewed perspective.  
**Thirteen:** Shit like this is why I got into goth fashion. Cover yourself in spikes and the pervs can’t get you as easy.  
**Thirteen:** #lifehacks

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/1decfeab7f4a6b0b85704f34c26cd49e/tumblr_inline_ouvaxtjSZs1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** ….  
**Thirteen:** Yeah I bet you do, strumpet. Special hugs.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/859dcca7681a2496560b177104907536/tumblr_inline_ouvb0fxe131qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:**  GET IN THE CAR LET ME DRIVE YOU BACK TO THE AIRPORT. GO TO A BALL GAME WITH YOUR MOTHER. BYE LOLITA.   
**Thirteen:** BAD TOUCH BAD TOUCH BAD TOUCH BAD TOUCH.  
**Me:**  A BAD TOUCH ON MY EYEBALLS.   
**Thirteen:** YES.  
**Thirteen:**  I NEED AN ADULT.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/580c464ace615da9f9bb48f1c5a3855b/tumblr_inline_ouvb3tbs8n1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** Please no.  
**Thirteen:** ….BAD TOUCH.  
**Thirteen:**  Humbert you will do NO SUCH THING.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/4a8a1dc9804e2c6ec0b0e49c94c096ec/tumblr_inline_ouvb75ci3l1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** I guess we finally get an explanation as to why she’s been out of touch for 10 years.   
**Thirteen:** What? She wanted her tiddies to pop out so she could seduce him easier?   
**Thirteen:**  (This word game I’m playing just accepted “poon” and I feel dirty.)

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/15b3903398133eb5c20e725465b066c3/tumblr_inline_ouvba3NA7S1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** I say Humbert takes some responsibility. What do you think?   
**Thirteen:**  Yeah, sure. Man up and accept what a dumbass you are, Humbert.

### **Blah blah blah Humbert feels bad about not calling. Continues to call her honey. Blah blah blah excuses about when she left the country. Blah blah blah. Something heartwarming happens and still manages to be creepy. All leading to this:**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/b0d75f87f722dbfb6410ebb3208fedc6/tumblr_inline_ouvbg9lNUP1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Thirteen:**  YOU STOP THAT RIGHT NOW YOU DISGUSTING HARLOT.  
**Me:** I EXPECTED YOUR MOTHER TO RAISE YOU BETTER THAN THIS.   
**Thirteen:**  jesus where IS her mom?  
**Thirteen:**  why is she not stopping her child from DOING TERRIBLE THINGS?  
**Me:**  I don’t know. I guess we’re her mothers now. Don’t worry child, we’ll stop you from getting dicked by your old man. And by that I mean, we’ll kill him. And you if you don’t stop being so thirsty.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/62b17ec3c7ddbf103c5c46ec3a7c3662/tumblr_inline_ouvblmgOUO1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:**  Okay Lolita. Take it down a notch.   
**Me:**  Or eleven.   
**Thirteen:** I’m not adopting this vile hellspawn.   
**Thirteen:** She’s at least as much to blame as him.  
**Thirteen:** So yeah, cleanse them with fire, etc.  
**Me:**  Brandish your sage knife.   
**Thirteen:** GONNA SAGE THIS GROSS SHIT OUT OF YOU BITCHES.

### **Blah blah blah Humbert wants her to be there too. Blah blah blah fatherly bullshit. Blah blah blah.** 

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/a031b56fabcbe8019466ee5fea30cb08/tumblr_inline_ouvbtvMofQ1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:**  Do we hug her or not?   
**Me:** I don’t wanna play into this little harlot’s trap.   
**Thirteen:**  Yeah I mean, it’s a good Dadly thing to do but…  
**Thirteen:**  That’s what this vile creature wants.  
**Me:**  …I’ll hug her. One time. For .00001 seconds.   
**Thirteen:** Awkwardly as fuck so she never wants another.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/422934417d56006603cc6d55fcf59a71/tumblr_inline_ouvbyb4Smm1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** I AM DISGUSTED   
**Me:**  BLOCKED BLOCKED BLOCKED   
**Me:** YOU’RE ALL BLOCKED   
**Thirteen:** EW EW EW LET GO OF THAT TARTED UP TWELVE YEAR OLD RIGHT THIS INSTANT HUMBERT.  
**Thirteen:** BAD TOUCH  
**Thirteen:** LEGITIMATELY

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/53ce91fbd1950519b7533a5ef821e9df/tumblr_inline_ouvc249xVv1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:**  If his couch is black, I’m leaving.   
**Thirteen:**  Ugh her sexbot pose is creeping me out more and more. This thing is Not Right.

### **Blah blah blah Lolita agrees. Some awkward fumbling. The screen goes black. And then:** 

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/141d8291742873f6d401f37f78ba55fa/tumblr_inline_ouvc5qm5yp1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:**  I vote go to another room.   
**Thirteen:** And never come back   
**Me:**  Kickflip into the sun.   
**Thirteen:**  It’s where he belongs tbh.  
**Me:**  I ACCIDENTALLY HIT COMPLIMENT TRYING TO GO BACK TO THE WINDOW   
**Thirteen:**  AUGH   
**Me:** OH MY GOD WHAT HAVE I DONE?

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/068e329406636be50f8e19c024b6239a/tumblr_inline_ouvcamJDon1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Thirteen:**  ABORT ABORT ABORT.  
**Me:**  DONALD TRUMP IS THAT YOU?

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/2a22db795782c6d8044377f1520f3e24/tumblr_inline_ouvccgVKQG1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooo   
**Thirteen:**  AAAAAUUUGGGHHHH.

### **And then we’re back at the choice screen with a third green point :/. I don’t like where this is going. I choose talk to her. There’s a conversation. Then:** 

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/981c5ef385e59f0576494257e6c22b47/tumblr_inline_ouvciiEiDy1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** Which is creepier? “How is your mother I divorced ten years ago?” or “Are you alone 😉 😉 \*nudge nudge\*”?   
**Thirteen:**  “How is your mom” is less creepy I think?  
**Thirteen:** That’s just nice chit-chat right?  
**Thirteen:** Catching up on her life in a non-gross way.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/a8478453b76cd9a6348e30516cff5d9c/tumblr_inline_ouvcm8yWyK1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** Brad sounds top notch, why not go and fuck him?   
**Thirteen:** Probably already did, that’s why she’s moved on to greener (grosser) pastures.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/2a0d7b0350c6d66256a065f3e624cbf4/tumblr_inline_ouvcqw1IWd1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:**  Way to not be creepy. Humbert.   
**Thirteen:**  He cccooould make sure she doesn’t have any bad impressions of him? In a good, dadly way?  
**Thirteen:** Or he’s a creeper which is the correct answer.   
**Humbert:** Does your mom ever mention \*blushes prettily and looks away\* how big my dick is?

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/7e6c4d2c8d7360fb20c32ad7e796eb91/tumblr_inline_ouvcwuDEhR1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:**  WOAAAH. BURN.   
**Thirteen:**  I mean she’s not wrong, as long as Brad doesn’t fuck kids. Especially *his* kids.   
**Me:** Yeah Humbert did set the bar pretty low.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/5dfb5f8f6a0d02c76796946372e051f7/tumblr_inline_ouvd1jhKu51qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:**  \*SLAMS MOUSE DOWN HARD ON SHE’S RIGHT\*   
**Thirteen:**  YES GOOD.  
**Thirteen:**  HUMBERT YOU DIDN’T EVEN CALL YOUR DAUGHTER AND KEEP STARING AT HER TITS YOU’RE ACTUALLY THE WORST!

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/a7b3e3ee3de3c86293357300796263ef/tumblr_inline_ouvd44vL5p1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Thirteen:**  Also she probably freaked out when you named your daughter Lolita  
**Thirteen:** Just saying.  
**Me:** YEAH HUMBERT. THINK OF OTHER PEOPLE FOR A CHANGE.

### **Humbert: \*teary eyed\* but I’ve *changed* and I can be a *better father*! You’ll see, LOLITA!** 

**Me:** Presumably once he has his dick in you.   
**Thirteen:** That’s how you dad, right?   
**Thirteen:** fuck up your relationship with your wife, get divorced, make it better by fucking your daughter who reminds you of her?  
**Me:**  Stick your dick in it, it’s diddly dang daddy done.

### **Lolita foolishly believes his claims. Humbert calls this a date again. Lolita is not at all freaked out by this. And we have 4 green points suddenly.** 

**Thirteen:** Of course she’s not freaked out.  
**Thirteen:**  This is clearly her goal.

### **Now they’re watching a fucking movie.** 

**Thirteen:** How many sex scenes does it have?  
**Thirteen:** Is it literally a FUCKING movie?

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/5e88885fb7b75bb99119baa690185e91/tumblr_inline_ouvdjhGBS81qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:**  I don’t know. We apparently get to choose.   
**Thirteen:**  Uuuuuhhhhh comedy seems safest?  
**Thirteen:** And man she has creepy teeth.   
**Me:** BETTER TO EAT DICK WITH, MY DEAR.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/ce96cbe1a7b994adb51337889afb5674/tumblr_inline_ouvdo67pKl1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:**  She looks like she’s seen something she can’t unsee.   
**Me:**  Is this where the optional beastiality comes in?  
**Me:** The comedy movie?  
**Me:** Have we opened a whole can of worms now?   
**Thirteen:** Oh, so it’s worms, then  
**Thirteen:** Not a dog after all   
**Me:** Ba dum tiss.  
**Thirteen:** We’re funny.  
**Thirteen:** To someone. Somewhere. Maybe.   
**Me:** <a>kuresoto</a>​ likes us.

**Me:** OH FUCK HOLY HELL.  
**Thirteen:** SHIT. WHAT?  
**Me:** I WENT TO SAVE MY GAME AND OVERWRITE THE OLD SAVE AND THIS HAPPENED.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/f5b098185e8eb1add8b4d726545c712f/tumblr_inline_ouvdu7sXPm1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Thirteen:** -SCREECH-  
**Thirteen:** ALSO HER ANATOMY IS FUCKED AS HELL.  
**Me:**  DON’T LOOK DIRECTLY AT IT OR YOU’LL GO INSANE   
**Thirteen:** DON’T WORRY MY FIRST REACTION WAS TO SHIELD MY EYES.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/227f90196eafe1dab69f3bdc23f1cc47/tumblr_inline_ouvdye4ELC1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:**  OH LOOK SOMETHING WAS FUNNY AHAHAHA HA…HAHAH….   
**Thirteen:** THAT SHIT WAS NOT HILARIOUS YOU SMUG LITTLE FUCK  
**Thirteen:** IT WAS VILE  
**Thirteen: *VILE***

### **Lolita goes in about French for like nine clicks. Humbert is glad she liked the movie. I’m just glad I’m not looking at a deformed naked sim. Now we’re gonna do something else. We have six green points now for some reason.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/e87d6be543f2999b00d0a87d5da4a7ae/tumblr_inline_ouve2t4Qwt1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** The only thing we haven’t done it gone to another room.   
**Thirteen:**  Ugh how do we make this gross harlot dislike us  
**Thirteen:** Welp   
**Thirteen:** One choice left I suppose   
**Humbert:** Bye bitch. Gonna go take a dump. Entertain yourself for a few hours.  
**Thirteen:** LMAO   
**Thirteen:** Gods, I hope so.

**Thirteen:** NO IT DOES NOT NEED TO BE A GROUP EVENT   
**Thirteen:** I THINK WE NEED SOME SPACE  
**Thirteen:** IT’S NOT ME IT’S YOU (AND YOUR DISGUSTING PROCLIVITIES)   
**Me:**  GO TAKE A DUMP, HUMBERT.   
**Thirteen:** ALONE. UNTIL SHE LEAVES.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/484edac8b507ec623f16206cdb96332b/tumblr_inline_ouvebvmCiH1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** GO TO THE BATHROOM, HUMBERT.   
**Thirteen:** OH GODS ALL OF THESE OPTIONS ARE TERRIFYING.  
**Me:** KITCHEN HAS KNIVES SO WE CAN KILL HIM.   
**Thirteen:** I WAS GOING TO SUGGEST THAT (it seems least terrifying)

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/13458243b245791627fe946118e7d8cc/tumblr_inline_ouvefdr1FD1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** \*WIDE EYES AND ACTUAL IRL SCREAMING\* PEDO SENSES TINGLING.  
**Thirteen:** JESUS YOU VILE CREATURE STOP STICKING YOUR TITS OUT CONSTANTLY  
**Thirteen:** I AM CONCERNED FOR YOUR SPINE   
**Me:**  UNSTUFF YOUR BRA AND PUT THOSE CHICKEN CUTLETS BACK IN THE BEDSIDE DRAWER WHERE THEY BELONG.

**Thirteen:**  for cock

### **Now instead of cooking they’re apparently going to go get something to eat which seems much safer. Oh wait.** 

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/975e356eeb45ae225ae9de1f91c1a535/tumblr_inline_ouvemerEt11qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Thirteen:** Jesus. Pizza? Maybe our utter awkwardness at 1) not asking if she was hungry earlier, or before dragging her into the kitchen combined with 2) specifically moving to the kitchen to order pizza will turn her off.  
**Thirteen:** Plus, maybe she’s allergic to pizza.   
**Me:** We are in accordance.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/68b4c224d57143d7df743fec31dfb832/tumblr_inline_ouvequAwt21qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Lolita:** SO YOU DO KNOW HOW TO USE A PHONE. I KNEW YOU NEVER LOVED ME.   
**Thirteen:**  IT’S TRUE CHILD WE HATE YOU TIME TO LEAVE.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/167b4e5fa5a1e4a7568e6d4b242d4781/tumblr_inline_ouvespv8io1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** WHY IS THIS EVEN AN OPTION   
**Me:** AND WHY ARE YOU CALLING THE DELIVERY GUY DIRECTLY   
**Thirteen:** Obviously that’s how pizza works  
**Thirteen:** there’s no places that make it   
**Thirteen:** just fleets of delivery guys who produce it magically, pulling it from somewhere unknown   
**Thirteen:** some have suggested: their asses

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/d8e6666c23b100a809eb3e17a982148e/tumblr_inline_ouvevrc4ph1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME?  
**Thirteen:** Great camera work. On the other hand, the vile she-demon is mostly off-screen with her creepy, soulless smile. But then again, she appears to be looking at Humbert’s crotch.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/dfb96e41a98eea32cce87c237d2a20d5/tumblr_inline_ouvf1tn8Yl1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** None of this is even relevant idgaf.   
**Thirteen:** White Wall Simulator: The Game!   
**Me:** Dude I’m pretty sure even that would be more entertaining than this. We could like, paint it white again. Watch the paint dry. In real time. For ten hours.   
**Thirteen:** Diligently watch to make sure nothing mars its perfect whiteness.  
**Me:** And not bone down on our obviously not 18-year-old daughter.   
**Thirteen:** The most important part of it, one could argue

### **The delivery guy comes. They’re at a table. Dildos in the background on a desk next to a shitty laptop.** 

**Thirteen:** Oh we moved to the dildo room, that’s good something…  
**Thirteen:** Runaway just came on my media player and I am Uncomfortable.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/372ea54c4e984047a08267571fdc7c88/tumblr_inline_ouvfauSp631qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** AND THIS IS AN OPTION. AGAIN HUMBERT, WHAT THE FUCK ELSE WERE YOU GOING TO DO?   
**Thirteen:** Is her shirt fucking glued to her ribcage or something?  
**Me:** Yes.  
**Thirteen:** \*in background, disgusted\* (oooooh, she’s a little runaway / daddy’s girl learned fast, all those things he couldn’t say)

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/b483c96384b981c70ceb707860a030d7/tumblr_inline_ouvffpjFPY1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** \*THROWS COMPUTER OUT WINDOW\*  
**Thirteen:** We return to White Wall Simulator: The Game, already in progress.  
**Me:** THAT IS OBVIOUSLY A DOOR, HUMBERT.   
**Thirteen:** He gets confused.

### **It was obviously the delivery guy. Humbert still cocks the entire thing up and it’s like 15 more clicks before he even takes his head out of his ass long enough to open the fucking door.** 

**Thirteen:** At this rate I’m surprised he managed to find the right hole on his wife. So the good news is he’s just making it easier for us to try and prevent this atrocity from happening.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/84bb759e32104d9f36beddd0ea5b60e0/tumblr_inline_ouvfm1TOOO1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** OH LOOK. PLANET OF THE APES.   
**Thirteen:** LOL  
**Thirteen:** That is totally some dude with a frozen pizza  
**Thirteen:** The “delivery guy” is just his neighbor isn’t he?  
**Thirteen:** And he’s tired of trying to convince Humbert he doesn’t even WORK in a pizza place  
**Thirteen:** So he just brings a frozen pizza over.  
**Me:** Sorry Paolo, you look vaguely Italian and vaguely ape-like so you obviously deliver pizza.   
**Thirteen:** I just noticed that box says “Italian style” and I am just laughing my ass off over here.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/b7355eb60c929ac9fb82ae10893a3924/tumblr_inline_ouvfqyFCE71qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** This is STILL going on   
**Thirteen:** Also that’s a great way to hold a pizza if you want all the toppings ooze into one corner  
**Thirteen:** Furthering my theory that it’s frozen.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/64c0565622b05381e192c98566f377e9/tumblr_inline_ouvfteFMy31qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** WHY ARE YOU INVITING HIM IN, HUMBERT? JUST TAKE THE FUCKING PIZZA.   
**Thirteen:** What the fuck???  
**Thirteen:** Are you going to pay him with Lolita??   
**Humbert:** EY YO LO. I AIN’T GOT NO CASHOLA ON ME SO I NEED YOU TO GIVE PAOLO HERE A BLOWIE.   
**Thirteen:** Thanks, now I’m trying not to wake the house up with my hyena shrieking   
**Me:** You’re welcome.

Also I’m your neighbor and this pizza is frozen.   
***Paolo:*** Also, what’s with the jailbait hooker?   
**Paolo:** Also nice stilts, sir.   
**Thirteen:** Seriously this camera is fucked.

**Paolo:** …you know, for jailbait. I am calling the cops the second I get out of this pedo den.

**Thirteen:** Such is his fate, being in this…thing.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/cd4de8d4d85c51ea39381a4808e8a1d1/tumblr_inline_ouvg8196HH1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** OH STARS IT GOT WORSE.  
**Thirteen:** Paolo your face is…doing…something terrible. I think your eyebrows might be trying to escape.   
**Me:** I love how we just silently agreed to call him Paolo.   
**Thirteen:**  Well it was that or we call him “delivery guy” which 1) is too long and 2) he isn’t anyway.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/c9a1e392d0cf9f48e535cc9200906c5d/tumblr_inline_ouvgc7c3fD1qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** AUGH PAOLO STOP BEING GROSS AND TERRIBLE AND LEAVE. WHY ARE YOU EVEN HERE?  
**Thirteen:** Because Humbert invited him in to perv over Lolita, obviously.  
**Me:** So he can swoop in and save her and do a fatherly fakeout by shoving his dick down her throat in place of Paolo’s Italian Sausage.   
**Thirteen:** Jesus, probably.   
**Thirteen:** You’re really dodging a bullet, Paolo. She likes dads. Namely, her own. Also, dogs, probably.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![image](https://i0.wp.com/66.media.tumblr.com/0604117e1c870e52ab0a2d9cba345f7e/tumblr_inline_ouvggjf5T11qdlic8_1280.png?w=685&ssl=1)</figure></div>**Me:** Gettin a little defensive there Humbert.   
**Thirteen:** He thought twice about the blowjob payment.   
**Thirteen:** Seriously though how tall is this cockwaffle?   
**Thirteen:** Or is he just surrounded by the shortest people he could find.

**Thirteen:** Even if they ARE your neighbors just giving you a frozen pizza to shut you up.

### **Lolita seems to think he was a nice guy. Humbert gets all pissy about it. Calls Paolo a douche.** 

### **“Those are the worst type honey. They have no respect for Women.” Blah blah blah.** 

### **She’s so ~naive~.** 

### **PROBABLY BECAUSE SHE’S TWELVE. AND NOT REALLY 18 AT ALL.** 

### **Are you sure she wasn’t 2 when you last saw her, Humbert? Hm????**

**Thirteen:** It would better explain why he didn’t recognize her at all.   
**Thirteen:** And like she’s not used to that bullshit with THOSE ta-tas. Well, except they’re fake.
