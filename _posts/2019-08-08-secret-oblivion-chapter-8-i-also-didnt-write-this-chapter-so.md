**Chapter 8 Secret Oblivion**

**Disclaimer:** I own not HP, but I do own Hannah.

**A/N:** Done by my friend Emily. Not written by me.

“Hold on”

When she finally made it home that night, she was so soaked with the rain that pneumonia would probably beat her to killing her. So she checked the answering machine, and to her amazement, there was one message. And then, to almost make her pass out, she heard Sirius’ voice coming over the intercom of the answering machine.

“We need to talk. Call me back.”

Astonished that he had actually called her, she shakily changed clothes and picked up the phone. Having his number on speed dial, she dialed 1. After about 3 rings, Sirius picked up:

“Hey” she started.

“I’m sorry; knocking you over like that was stupid. It’s just…what is going on?”

“I’d tell you, its just…you probably wouldn’t listen.”

“Lets meet for coffee and we’ll figure this out.”

“Ok.”

“Ok. Meet me in 30 minutes at the Leaky Cauldron.”

“Ok”

“And Hannah?”

“yeah?”

“I miss you”

I’ve been here before a few times  
And I’m quite aware we’re dying  
And your hands they shake with goodbyes  
And I’ll take you back if you’d have me  
So here I am I’m trying  
So here I am are you ready

Come on let me hold you touch you feel you  
Always  
Kiss you taste you all night  
Always

And I’ll miss your laugh your smile  
I’ll admit I’m wrong if you’d tell me  
I’m so sick of fights I hate them  
Lets start this again for real

So here I am I’m trying  
So here I am are you ready  
So here I am I’m trying  
So here I am are you ready

Come on let me hold you touch you feel you  
Always  
Kiss you taste you all night  
Always  
Touch you feel you  
Always  
Kiss you taste you all night  
Always

I’ve been here before a few times  
And I’m quite aware we’re dying

Come on let me hold you touch you feel you  
Always  
Kiss you taste you all night  
Always  
Touch you feel you  
Always  
Kiss you taste you all night  
Always

**A/N:** a very excited friend who loves my story a lot did this chapter. She did a very good job, despite the fact it’s so short. She would’ve done a re-write, but her computer crashes so I guess this will have to do. I’m not familiar with the song…but yeah. This story should have a good chapter up soon, but until I get around to writing it, put up with my friends doing guest chapters. I might just write a quick chapter after this one. Sorry if it sucks.
