From start to finish, this book is a complete science fiction masterpiece. I was hooked right away. Science fiction is one of my all-time favorite genres and William Aicher knows exactly what he’s doing.

He creates a world where David S. Sparks is dropped, with no memories, into a very dangerous place. He meets what is essentially a terrorist, who befriends him and takes him on a long journey through some really interesting places (as you can see I’m trying not to spoil anything).

There is a lot of things that are super creepy and somewhat gross that happen to David on his journey, but they make the story so much better. There’s all this action and adventure and mishaps in this world David knows nothing about.

There’s a huge reveal about ¾ of the way through that I never saw coming. And, to be honest, I have a really easy time guessing plot points. The fact that William Aicher managed to keep me in the dark until he was ready for me to know that information is incredible. I actually had to stop reading for a few days to recover.

The prose and overall writing structure of David Sparks flows so smoothly from one idea and one chapter to the next. The writing is incredible and so professional. This has got to be in my top 5 favorite books I’ve read this year.

Great job, William, I look forward to reading more from you.
