So close I could taste the poison on your lips  
so far I could feel your fingertips  
I could feel the tears were gone  
but now it’s wrecked  
this crippling pain is in my chest  
I used to be so happy,  
I could handle it…

But now you’ve ripped my heart free  
and broke it in your hands  
and you tell me I don’t mean a thing  
and I just have to  
*WISH* you didn’t.
