It is so fucking frustrating as an indie author when people have been reviewing your book but Amazon is like naw fam, I don’t feel like posting this.

This has been happening to me so often that fans (not just my writer friends, actual fans) have reached out annoyed that their review is *still* not listed on my book page.

At this point, it isn’t even that Amazon is deleting them. Like, I haven’t even SEEN them. Amazon is legit just not posting them at all. What the fuck?

These are people who actually purchased my book, read it, enjoyed it, and want to post a review. Why is Amazon doing this?

It doesn’t make any sense. Like I’m not paying for reviews, I’m hardly even begging my friends to review it because I legit know they won’t.

These are legitimate fans of my work like **post their fucking reviews Amazon, you coward.**
