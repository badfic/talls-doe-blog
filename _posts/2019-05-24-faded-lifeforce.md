In solitude she wakes  
drawing with chalk  
on the walls and marking  
the day with a short line

She doesn’t know what time it is  
or how she got here, buried down  
deep, deep, deep in the earth  
but she does know how many  
pink, white, purple, green, blue  
lines are on the wall   
&amp;  
how many days it’s been  
since the sun peeks through   
the holes in the bars  
&amp;  
she knows how scared she is  
and how lonely it is inside

At night she dreams about   
anger and flashing images  
of desperation and a fight  
and now she’s somewhere  
where there’s water droplets  
dripping and rats scavenging  
and her only friend is the   
occasional *silence*  
between squeals and   
the rhythmic  
drip, drop, drip  
of the water

And her whole body aches for just  
one second of peace and a meal  
she didn’t steal from a rodent  
with a mouth full of disease

She’s so alone.
