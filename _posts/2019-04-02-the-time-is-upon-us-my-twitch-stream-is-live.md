I am so excited to share [Marjorie Diaz’s Unfortunate Introduction to Ancestral Politics &amp; Foul Play](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P86KDNM) with all of you! I’ve been working on this book since the second I published the first one, [Marjorie Diaz’s Unfortunate Introduction to Magical High Society](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FBWBDYR?ref_=pe_3052080_276849420) last year.

I can’t believe it’s finally happening! [My fourth book](https://www.amazon.com/Desdemona-Wren/e/B07B4WG4S8/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_1)!

You came here to learn about my [twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/wrenzday)! So let me break it down for ya.

I’ll be live on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/wrenzday) for about 6 hours playing various video games from now (3pm Pacific time) to 9pm (PDT) and we are gonna have a blast.

6:00-7:00: I try to play Bomberman &amp; read the Bomberman scene from Book 1

While I do all of this, I will be answering questions about myself and [my books](https://desdemonawren.com) and hosting various giveaways.
