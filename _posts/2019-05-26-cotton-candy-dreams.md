My heart broke the night we stared at the moon &amp;  
you told me that you’d never stop loving me &amp;  
we fell asleep in the grass, close to keep warm &amp;  
in the morning when I woke up to the sun &amp;   
*you were gone* – a whisper of the night &amp;  
the shadow from my dream the night I never cried again.  
  
My heart breaks to see your smile off in the distance *like*  
a beacon in the night, guiding me to some far off reality *like*  
a dream where we’re together all the time and not *like*  
we’re separated by an hour and 74.6782 miles – I counted.  
  
My heart swells with every step you take towards me **with**  
your arms open, waiting to hold me in them and kiss me **with**  
all your love, all your might, all your being and no matter what I know  
without any doubt that there’s no place I’d rather be than here **with**  
you right now, away from reality in a world of spinning colors and cotton candy  
dreams and real smiles and everything I could’ve ever wanted…  
  
*but there goes my alarm clock again*
