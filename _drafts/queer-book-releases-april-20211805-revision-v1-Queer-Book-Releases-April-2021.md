I want to say a quick thank you to my Discord server, [The Swamp](https://discord.gg/Gj7FhMKtDG) for encouraging myself, @lisa-stapleton, and @lee\_lei\_lp to do this monthly queer books list. I know there’s a million more out there, but I hope ours specifically adds a little something to your day.

Also! For the entire month of April we’re doing Camp NaNo challenges, sprints, and workshops in [The Swamp](https://discord.gg/Gj7FhMKtDG)! So drop in and say hi! We’d love to have you.

## [Zara Hossain Is Here](https://amzn.to/2PuWiST) by Sabina Khan

### *Releases on: April 6* – Sourced by @lee\_lei\_lp

*young adult, slice of life, school life*

Zara is a high school student struggling against dangerous Islamophobia and targeted bullying. Her journey is marked by difficult and important discussions around racism and white privilege, gun violence, and homophobia. While Zara’s bisexuality doesn’t cause strife in her family, she sees that it is an issue in the US.

Side note: One review points out that the book has LGBT characters beyond the MC and her immediate circle, as well as trans inclusive feminism!

## [Malice](https://amzn.to/3sKLXka) by Heather Walter

### *Releases: April 13 – Sourced by @lee\_lei\_lp*

## [Leaving Isn’t the Hardest Thing Essays](https://amzn.to/3fMOlTZ) by Lauren Hough

### *Releases: April 13 – Sourced by @lisa-stapleton*

In 2018, Hough’s eye-opening essay about the decade she spent as a cable guy in the suburbs of Washington D.C.—fixing phone, TV, and internet lines for “the American id in its underpants”—went viral. That piece is reprinted here, along with ten more staggering slices of autobiography, all of which reside in that sweet spot between devastating and irreverent. Though Hough has lived many lives—an airman, a cult survivor, a bartender—her brand of deadpan candidness is singular.

### *Releases April 13 – Sourced by* @desdemona-wren

**In *A Crown So Cursed*, the third book in L.L. McKinney’s Nightmare-Verse series, Alice is called to save Wonderland from itself.**

Alice is doing her best to recover from her last boss battle, but members of her crew start having these… dreams.

And they’re all the same dream: visions of a dark past—and an even darker future. It seems the evil in Wonderland may not be as defeated as they’d hoped.

When word spreads of an encroaching army of Nightmares unlike any ever seen, Alice finds she may have to step between the coming darkness and the mortal world once more.

But this time is different.

This time, the monsters aren’t waiting for her on the other side of the Veil.

They’re in her own back yard.

NOTE: This is the third book in an AMAZING series.
