**A. Psychology**

**What of the Meyers-Briggs personality types they most fit into? INFP, ENFT, et cetera…**

This isn’t something Jasmine cares about or knows.

**What alignment are they? Chaotic neutral, lawful evil, et cetera…**

Jasmine is probably Lawful Good up until a certain point where she either becomes True Neutral or Chaotic good.

**Do they have any emotional or psychological conditions? Are they aware of it?**

All Wixen are *aware* of the cost of casting and use of magic. It’s just a thing their species has to deal with. She suffers from mild anxiety in social interactions as well just in addition to the whole. Magic slowly melting your brain thing.

**Do they try to treat it?**

The symptoms are easily treated with potions, but the root cause has no cure. Even wixen who don’t use casting will experience the same sort of problems.

**Are they a pessimist or an optimist?**

Jasmine is probably an optimist, but in a cynical way.

**Are they good at handling change in their life?**

Sure?

**Does your OC tend to assume their interpretation of events and reality is correct, or do they question it? I.e., “I’m sure that’s what you said” versus “It’s possible I misheard you.”**

This question is stupid and Jasmine doesn’t want to answer it.

**Is your OC confident in their reactions to life in general, or do they get embarrassed or easily shamed for it? I.e., if something startles them, do they insist it WAS scary? When they cry, do they feel like they overreacted?**

Jasmine is often easily embarrassed because of social anxiety and her voice getting shrill and weird when she talks to pretty girls who may or may not work in potion shops.

**Is your OC a martyr?**

What the fuck does this mean. I doubt Jasmine is gonna die for a cause any time soon.

**Does your OC make a lot of excuses? For themselves? Others?**

No.

**Does your OC compromise easily? Too easily?**

She lets her older brother push her around a lot. They’re so precious.

**Does your OC put others’ needs before their own?**

Probably. Especially where her brother is concerned. Caspian is kind of a mess.

**Does your OC have any addictions? If so and problematic, have they admitted it to themselves?**

By nature, all casters are addicted to casting.

**Does your OC have any phobias? If so, where did they come from?**

She does, but nothing she’s ready to admit.

**Is your character empathetic?**

Certainly. She’s a beat peace keeping cop that has to deal a lot with diffusing emotional situations that could lead to an overuse of casting. She has to be empathetic in order to do her job.

**Is your character observant?**

Yes.

**Does your OC have to go through their own trials to learn a lesson, or do they listen and learn from observation and lecture? I.e., does your OC listen when someone tries to tell them the importance of budgeting, or do they have to go experience what happens if you don’t budget first?**

This was too long and I didn’t read it. Jasmine is frowning at me.

**What’s one of your OC’s proudest moments of themselves?**

Not murdering her brother.

**Do they get jealous easily? Do they feel bad if they do?**

She can get jealous, yeah. Probably not easily. She doesn’t feel bad about it. Especially considering ALL PARTIES PRESENT KNEW HOW SHE FELT AND DID THE THING ANYWAYS. She was justified in her jealousy.

**What instantly irritates them or puts them in a bad mood?**

Whenever her brother is sick or he pushes himself too hard and hurts himself.

**Are they harsh on themselves?**

She used to be, but now she’s learned to take things in stride. She can’t be constantly hard on herself with her brother to worry about.

**Is your OC intended to be found generally attractive? Unattractive? Average? Is there a reason why?**

I mean, I’m her mother so I’m always gonna think my baby is beautiful. Though, I wouldn’t say she’s conventionally attractive. She has too big eyes with pretty heavy dark circles underneath, a too small upper lip with an enormous pouty lower one that she thinks makes her look like a turtle, and her hair never wants to cooperate. She has a huge fluff of kinky curls that somehow are always busting out of clips.

**Does your OC place much importance on their appearance? Do they feel confident in it?**

She wears light makeup, has a skin care routine, etc. Most of this is taken care of by potions so it’s easier for people in this reality to have routines like this. Plus Jasmine likes the repetitive nature of putting makeup on. She’s into calming repetitive stuff.

**What are some of your OC’s biggest personal obstacles? This could be emotional, physical, social… Are they aware of it? Are they trying to overcome it?**

Honestly there’s a lot going on in her life right now, but her biggest obstacle is likely her brother’s unwillingness to care about her feelings as far as the girl in the potion shop goes.

**B. Social**

**Do they believe you have to give respect to get it, or get respect to give it?**

Dude whatever. Respect is respect is respect. Jasmine doesn’t need to answer this.

**Do they get frustrated when lines at places like pharmacies, check-outs, delis, banks, et cetera, are moving slowly?**

No. She lives in a city. There are always lines.

**Under what situations would they get angry at servers, staff, customer service, et cetera?**

She doesn’t.

**Do they tip well? How easily can they be moved to not leave a tip?**

Yes.(TIP YOUR SERVERS, PEOPLE)

**Do they hold doors open for people?**

No.

**Would your OC let someone ahead of them in line if your OC had a big cart and the person behind them had very few items?**

No.

**How do they respond to babies crying in public?**

She ignores them like every other sane person. That’s not her kid.

**Is your OC considered funny? Do they believe they’re funny?**

Probably. And no, she doesn’t think she’s funny.

**What kind of humor does your OC like the most? Slapstick, ironic, funny sounds, scare pranks, xD sO rAnDoM…**

None of the above. Her sense of humor is there, but pretty refined. She likes dry humor.

**Does your OC find any “bad” or “mean” humor funny? Do they wish they didn’t?**

Sure. She’s a caster. There are always going to be things you find funny (that aren’t funny) when you’re casted out.

**Your OC is running late to meeting someone: Do they let the other person know? Do they lie about why they’re late?**

The other person knows and doesn’t care. Jasmine cares a lot, but it’s not something she apologizes for. She’s rarely late.

**Your OC orders something to eat and gets their order done in a pretty wrong way, something they can’t just pick off or whatnot to correct, or something major is missing. What do they do?**

Jasmine doesn’t order much “off menu” but if this did happen she’d probably send it back so the cooks could correct it or ask for the missing item. That or she wouldn’t care.

**Do they have a large or small group of friends?**

She has a pretty large group of friends. Most of them cops, some she still knows from college. They go to jazz clubs and stuff.

**Do they have people they (that?) are genuinely honest with about themselves?**

Her brother.

**Does your OC enjoy social events, such as parties, clubs, et cetera..?**

She does, sure. She’s introverted, but she can enjoy going out. Just not too much.

**Does your OC like to be the center of attention or more in the mix?**

Why can’t she just fade into the background and observe?

**C. Morality**

**Does your OC have a moral code? If not, how do they base their actions? If so, where does it come from, and how seriously do they take it?**

Yes. It comes from her not being a shitty person and she takes that very seriously.

**Would your OC feel bad if they acted against their morals? If not, would they find a way to excuse themselves for it?**

Yes.

**Is it important for them to be with people (socially, intimately, whatever) whose major ideological tenets align with their own?**

No.

**Do they consider themselves superior or more important than anyone else? Lesser?**

No.

**Do your OC’s morals and rules of common decency go out the window when it comes to those they don’t like, or when it’s inconvenient? Aka, are their morals situational?**

I’m gonna say yeah. People change. Dynamic characters are the best characters.

**What do they do when they see someone asking for money or food? If they ignore them, why? If they help, how so?**

She’s a big ol’ softy. Buys coats and food for the homeless in their neighborhood. She often uses her position in law enforcement to help them out too. There are a lot of shelters around and she and some of the other cops are constantly checking in to make sure everything is running smoothly.

There are a lot of initiatives for the homeless in Wixen universe. It comes with the territory. It’s possible a lot of casters could end up losing their livelihood due to the circumstances of their “illness” and they’ve come up with ways to combat this by having special housing for the homeless and the permanently casted out that are too far gone to remain in society.

**Do they believe people change over time? If so, is it a natural process or does it take effort?**

Yes.

**Is your OC more practical or ideal morally? I.e., do they hold people to high expectations of behavior even if it’s not realistic for the situation, or do they have a more realistic approach and adapt their morality to be more practical?**

Practical.

**D. Religion and Life and Death**

**How religious is your OC? What do they practice, if anything? If they don’t associate with any religion, what do they think of religion in general?**

In Wixen, monotheistic religions didn’t gain a lot of traction, so most of the religions are different than what people in our universe would believe. They have gods and goddesses and stuff like that. It’s normal for people, who utilize the old ways with spells and witchcraft, to worship the sun and the moon and the elements.

Jasmine doesn’t buy into the old ways. She’s more progressive so she isn’t very religious. She may burn a candle for the goddess of the moon every year on the solstice. She likes the moon goddess. The sun god never hears from her though.

**Do they believe in an afterlife?**

In Wixen, the general belief is that after death everyone becomes energy that goes back into the laylines to feed future magical generations.

**How comfortable are they with the idea of death?**

Fairly comfortable.

**Would they like to be immortal? Why, why not? If they are immortal, would they rather not be?**

Immortality isn’t something she likes to think about.

**Do they believe in ghosts? If not, why? If so, do they think they’re magical/tie into their religion, or are they scientifically plausible?**

Ghosts are definitely real. Why would they not be real? Spirits that have unfinished business are everywhere. Or people that just didn’t wanna die and end up in the layline. They’re around.

**E. Education and Intelligence**

**Would you say that your OC is intelligent? In what ways? Would your OC agree?**

Jasmine isn’t like wowwwowoow IQ of 9000 smart, but she’s not an idiot either. She’d definitely agree that she isn’t an idiot.

**Which of the nine types of intelligence is your OC strongest in? Weakest? (Linguistic, existential, naturalist, et cetera)**

This is a dumb question.

**How many languages do they speak?**

Four.

**Did they enjoy school if they went to it?**

Sure.

**What’s their highest education level? Do they want to continue their education?**

Bachelor’s.

**Do they enjoy learning? Do they actively seek out sources of self-education?**

Who doesn’t enjoy learning? Yes.

**Are they a good note-taker? Are they a good test-taker? Do exams make them nervous?**

Yes, yes, yes.

**What’s one of your OC’s biggest regrets?**

How she treated her brother after she lost her leg.

**F. Domestic Habits, Work, and Hobbies**

**What sort of home do they live in now, if at all? How did they end up there?**

She lives in a spacious apartment with her brother in Briarville, Delaware. They ended up there because of work.

**What’s their ideal home look like? Where is it?**

She likes where she lives. Maybe one day she’ll have a farm in the country with a bunch of rescue creatures where she can rehabilitate them, but for now she wouldn’t trade her apartment for the world.

**Could they ever live in a “tiny home”?**

That’s just a trailer with extra steps.

**How clean are they overall with home upkeep?**

Their home is clean, but definitely lived in.

**How handy are they? Can they fix appliances, cars, cabinets, et cetera?**

Most things can be fixed with a well placed rune and a little casting. Things that can’t be, she just calls someone else to do it.

**How much do they work? What do they do? Do they enjoy it?**

She’s a beat cop so she works every day. She likes her job.

**What’s their “dream career” or job situation?**

Probably a detective or a magical creature rehabilitator.

**How often are they home?**

Every night?

**Are they homebodies and enjoy being home?**

She likes being at home on her days off. That or out in nature. Wixen like nature.

**Do they engage in any of the arts? How good do you intend them to be? Would they agree they are?**

She was a fairly decent ballet dancer in her youth. She stopped doing in professionally when she left college and moved on to a more practical career she could see herself maintaining long term.

**What are some of their favorite things to do for recreation? How did they get into it? What part of it do they like the most?**

She likes to read and listen to jazz. The rest of this question is dumb.

**Would they enjoy a theme park?**

Probably? She likes looking at weird stuff and occasionally likes fair food.

**G. Family and Growing Up**

**Is your OC close to their family?**

Extremely.

**Who makes up your OC’s family, at least the more important members to them?**

Her mother and older brother and step father. Her biological father died when she was young. He was a cool guy and is dearly missed.

**Does your OC find their family supportive? If not, what would be an example why not?**

Yeah, sure.

**What kind of childhood did your OC have?**

A good one. She lost her leg due to her brother’s shenanigans, but other than that and her father passing she was very well loved. (Except for Dave. Fuck that guy. Her mother re-married early on because of grief and Dave was a douuuche.)

**Did they go through any typical phases growing up?**

No?

**Do they have any favorite childhood memories?**

Yes.

**Do they have any childhood memories they’d rather forget or be less affected by?**

Of course.

**H. Romance and Intimacy**

**What is your OC’s orientation, romantic and/or sexual? Has it ever been a source of stress for them? Have they always been pretty sure of their orientation?**

Jasmine is a lesbian. She’s also trans. It’s only ever been a source of stress where Dave was concerned. In Wixen, society generally accepts LGBT due to the monotheistic religions not really taking root and most people are kinda just like. Whatever. There are some people out there with differing opinions, but it is very rare.

She’s not always been sure of her orientation.

**Is your OC a thoughtful partner, in whatever aspect of that you want to cover?**

She probably is. Or as much as she can be with the whole magic thing.

**Does your OC believe there’s only one ideal partner (or multiple ideal if not monogamous) for everyone, or that there are many people who could be right?**

What.

**Does your OC believe in love in first sight?**

Not love, no. She falls in love slowly. She can generally gauge if she’s going to be attracted to someone at first sight, though.

**Does your OC believe in marriage (or their culture’s equivalent)?**

Sure.

**Has your OC ever cheated on anyone or been cheated on?**

Yeah, dude.

**What do they look for in partners? (Emotionally, mentally, physically…)**

Honestly Jasmine is attractive to clever women that are independent and sort of not terrible.

**What’s your OC’s idea of a perfect date?**

A jazz concert in a foggy club with someone she genuinely cares about.

**What are some things that your OC finds to be an instant turn-off in potential partners?**

Probably stabbing her in the hand. \*GLARES POINTEDLY AT VIOLET\*

**I. Food**

**What are their favorite kinds of flavors– Sweet, salty, sour, spicy, creamy, et cetera?**

She likes rice.

**Do they have any eating requirements or preferences? Allergies, vegetarian, organic-only, religious restrictions…**

No.

**Are they vegan/vegetarian (if their overall culture/species generally aren’t)? If so, why? Do they think animal products are wrong in all circumstances?**

No.

**How often do they cook? Do they order out a lot?**

Every night.

**Are they a good cook?**

Pretty average. Caspian is the better cook.

**Could they eat the same thing they enjoy over and over and not get bored of it quickly?**

No.

**J. Politics, Current Events, Environmental Aspects**

**Where does your OC stand most politically? What would they align with most?**

Honestly I haven’t thought much about the political climate in Wixen.

**How politically aware are they?**

It’s likely she’s very politically aware.

**How politically active are they?**

Very.

**Is your OC the sort to fall for fake news? If not, do they ignore it or make a point to clarify that it’s wrong?**

Probably not.

**Are they or would they protest for a cause they’re passionate about?**

Definitely.

**How do they react to people whose political viewpoints are very opposite of theirs?**

As long as they aren’t dangerous, she ignores them.

**How much interest in environmental health do they have?**

The environment is VERY important to caters. Most of their cities are overgrown by plant life.

**In reality-based or applicable worlds, do they believe in global warming? Do they recycle?**

**L. For the Writer/Owner**

**How have your characters changed since you created them?**

She’s changed a *lot* – originally she was Yamato from Naruto for an RP. Until eventually this RP became something completely different and turned into this crack RP with Yamato/Kakashi/Kasumi/Oniyuri as wizards. Then it became it’s own story where she was originally named Rowan and was a dude. Now her name is Jasmine and she’s cool.

Like man she started out as Japanese, then white, now she’s Portuguese/french, but her father was black so that’s a thing.

**What do you consider the biggest themes in your character, if any?**

Being the best gay she can be.

**Did you create the character to be like yourself, did they end up being like yourself, or are they very different from you?**

Lol no. She’s cooler than I am.

**Would you hang out with your OC if you could?**

Gross hanging out with people.

**How did you come up with your OC?**

Was originally part of a Naruto RP that spiraled out of control.
