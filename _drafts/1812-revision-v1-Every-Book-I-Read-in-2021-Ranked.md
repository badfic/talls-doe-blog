I know this says “ranked” but this is going to go in read order. I haven’t published anything on my blog in like, a year, even though I have so much content saved up.

So, I’ve decided to show y’all my book spreadsheet (sort of) and share some of my ratings, notes, class systems, etc. I’ve broken them apart by month to give the list more depth.

Series are marked with a \*

✨ Anything rated 5 stars (or higher) is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED  
✨ Anything rated 4 stars is a GREAT READ  
✨ Anything rated 3 stars is an OKAY READ  
✨ Anything rated 2 stars or lower that I didn’t DNF is A MIRACLE

## Upside Down Magic by Sarah Mlynowski\*

**Middle Grade Urban Fantasy &amp; Magical Schools**

*Nory, Elliott, Andres, and Bax are just four of the students in Dunwiddle Magic School’s Upside-Down Magic class. In their classroom, lessons are unconventional, students are unpredictable, and magic has a tendency to turn wonky at the worst possible moments. Because it’s always amazing, the trouble a little wonky magic can cause*.

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5 stars

## Sticks &amp; Stones by Sarah Mlynowski\*

**Middle Grade Urban Fantasy &amp; Magical Schools**

*When things get messy, it’s easy to point your finger at the kids with the messiest magic. But the Upside-Down Magic students aren’t going to let themselves get in trouble. Instead, they’re going to find out what’s really going on — and get their school back on track before something really wacky happens.*

*Some people in school are afraid of the kids in the Upside-Down Magic class. Others just call them flops. But Nory and her friends in Upside-down Magic won’t let that stop them. Not with a school-wide talent show coming up!*

**Middle Grade Urban Fantasy &amp; Magical Schools | 2017 | 3 Hours | Neurodiversity Rep**

Nory and Andres are in an Upside-Down Magic class with other kids who have unusual magic. Now they’re off on their first-ever overnight field trip! At Dragon Haven, Nory, Andres, and their UDM classmates get to swim with dragons, fly with dragons, and feed dragons. There’s even a Hatchery, where they might get to see a newborn dragon.

*When Willa’s upside-down magic rains, it pours. Clouds form under ceilings. Classrooms get flooded. Nory and the kids in Ms. Starr’s Upside-Down Magic class always have umbrellas nearby, just in case.*

**Literary Fiction | 2000 | 11 Hours** | **MTF Trans** Rep

*It starts with a question, a simple favour asked by a wife of her husband while both are painting in their studio, setting off a transformation neither can anticipate. Uniting fact and fiction into an original romantic vision, The Danish Girl eloquently portrays the unique intimacy that defines every marriage and the remarkable story of Lili Elbe, a pioneer in transgender history, and the woman torn between loyalty to her marriage and her own ambitions and desires.*
