As many of you know, I’m a massive supporter of animation. I’ll be the first person to tell you to stop sleeping on cartoons because you think they’re childish. Modern animation is for everyone and some of these cartoons have better story lines than any live action production.

That being said, I want to share with all of you my Top 10 Favourite Cartoons of All Time (That you should all definitely watch if you haven’t seen them already) and a few honourable mentions.

These cartoons are listed in no particular order, I’m not sure I could put them in an order even if I tried. They’re all a little too lose to my heart.

## Gravity Falls

At it’s heart, Gravity falls is a show about two pre-teen twins from California that go to stay with the Great Uncle Stan in Oregon and uncover the mystery to end all mysteries. It was created by Alex Hirsh, and it contains a bunch of Rick and Morty easter eggs in it as well. Which I thought was a pretty cool selling point, other than it’s probably one of the greatest animated shows to exist this side of Avatar the Last Airbender.

## Avatar the Last Airbender &amp; The Legend of Korra

ATLA was the renaissance of modern animation. This is the reason we have the cartoons we have now. If you’re not aware of the premise of this show, considering how wildly popular it is, the best way I can sum it up is this:

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote">> “*Water. Fire. Earth. Air. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang. And although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he’s ready to save anyone. But I believe Aang can save the world.*“

</figure>The Legend of Korra also made this slot because I believe both shows should be paired together. You cannot have one without the other. Nor should you.

The Legend of Korra is the follow up to Avatar the Last Airbender. It follows the new avatar: Korra and how she navigates being the avatar in a time of accelerated change. I genuinely love both of these shows and I am so eternally grateful for the waves they made in animation. I will also always be grateful to Legend of Korra for being the first cartoon to show a bisexual couple.

## Ducktales (2017)

This one surprised me. I watched this for the first time last year in March and ended up getting so attached to it I created content (fanfiction, fanart, essays) for the show. Ducktales (2017) is probably the best cartoon reboot I have ever seen in my life. Not only does it do justice to the original, it *surpasses* it in quality. The narrative of this show is incredible, the artwork and animation are *incredible*, the voice acting cast is *immaculate*. The way this dragged me from the depths of hell and put me onto solid ground.

Ducktales (2017) follows Huey, Dewey, and Louie, their Uncle Donald, their best friend Webby, and their adventurous Uncle Scrooge chasing down treasure and making waves in Duckburg. This show gave so much and the emotional hold it had on me was and is, very, *very* real.

## The Proud Family

In my opinion, The Proud Family should’ve never stopped airing. As a very sheltered person growing up in the deep south, this gave me some of the best representation. There are aspects of it that haven’t aged well and it was never really inter-sectional enough and it did have its problems. Still one of the best cartoons to ever exist.

The Proud Family follows the life and times of Penny Proud and how she navigates her sometimes strange and always loving family. The dynamics between the characters are amazing and I genuinely cannot wait to see where they take the reboot that is THANKFULLY still happening.

## Craig of the Creek

This show is nothing short of Black Excellence. It’s basically what Codename: Kids Next Door WISHES it could be. This show is creative and funny and, honestly, so, *SO* deeply queer. I feel so represented every time I watch this show. From how they honour queer relationships to the racial diversity of the cast. They even have diverse family units.

I slept on this show for way too long. Don’t be like me.
