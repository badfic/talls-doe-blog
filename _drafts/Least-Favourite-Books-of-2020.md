20 Least favourite books from 2020

20. Gideon the Ninth
21. I Hope you get this message  
    (It’s the anticlimactic ending for me. Made the book feel like it wasn’t worth reading)
22. Girls of Storm and Shadow
23. Infinity Son
24. Of Curses and Kisses
25. Only Mostly Devastated
26. Yes No Maybe So
27. The Wedding Date
28. Lifeblood
29. Spell Hacker
30. American Royals  
    0/10 Stars. An absolute heteronormative nightmare that wasn’t worth the paper it’s printed on.
31. Midnight Sun  
    The only good thing I got out of reading this long ass edgy emofest was “Eggony”.
32. All Your Twisted Secrets  
    Literally what the fuck.
33. You Should See Me in a Crown  
    This book came HIGHLY recommended from ALL of my friends but I hated it? I could not get into the main character and her issues. She just seemed really stuck up.
34. The Vanishing Deep  
    I wanted this to be a “mourning my sister and reconnecting with her murder mystery” book, but instead I got “shitty pining YA love story” and that really fucking sucked.
35. Obsidian  
    Just don’t read this book I was bored out of my skull. Like it’s so unoriginal. It’s just Twilight with aliens and 150,000 too many sequels.
36. These Witches Don’t Burn  
    Oh my god all I care about is the magic not you whining about your love interest you just met 5 seconds and are completely obsessed with romantically. Shut UP. Also why is everyone white? Seriously? It’s 20-fucking-20. Get with the times.
37. Heart of Iron by Ash Poston
38. Nevernight  
    Okay, we get it you edgelord motherfucker, you wanna fuck teenage girls. Now shut up.
39. The Ultimates (Avengers)  
    DISGUSTING. That’s all I have to say about this. UTTERLY the woRST Avengers arc to ever be written. WHY.
40. Wayward Son  
    Oh my god Rainbow fucking Rowell is honestly one of the worst writers out here. I absolutely hate how she takes up a huge portion of the book market that could go to ownvoices and BIPOC writers when all she does is do the bare minimum in her storytelling and use racial slurs in her books. Literally stop.
