For this I’m just going to do books I read in 2020. I don’t know if they came out in 2020 or not, though I’m sure I did read a few that came out this year, but for the sake of my own sanity, I’m not going to limit myself to 2020 only titles.

Unlike my really long really difficult to put together list from 2019, I’ll be doing something more laid back and easy peasy. In 2021 I’m trying to make things less needlessly complicated. So each book will probably have a few sentences written about it and some questions like “Is it gay?” or “Did it make you cry?” and a star rating.

That’s it. Anything more difficult will be too much.

Also please note: I will only be including first books in series, but the ranking pertains to the entire series as a whole.

20\. How It All Blew Up

I thought this book was really good. I sort of love the interviewee type writing style and the breaks to check in with the family and build an entire story that way, but I felt like it lacked character development overall and it needed to be a little bit longer. It ended really abruptly and while the ending works, I think it could’ve been better.

3.5/5 Stars

19\. Bookish and the Beast by Ashley Poston

Another excellent addition to the Once Upon a Con series! I absolutely love these books, they’re very simple and low conflict which is one of my absolute favourite things about them. Plus, I’m a sucker for modern takes on classic fairy tales and Poston knows exactly what I want when it comes to that.

That said, this book could’ve been a lot gayer and could’ve gone more in-depth into the characters a little bit more. Also, it’s sort of starting to dawn on me, like why would Hollywood pick a bunch of teenaged actors for a massive property like Starfield? That’s kind of a massive plot hole?

4.5/5 Stars

18\. I Kissed Alice

This was very sweet and a pretty decent slow burn, but I’m not a fan of the miscommunication trope. I choked it down for the sapphics and this was resolved a lot more beautifully than any of the million het miscommunication tropes that have been forced upon me, but the fighting and cattiness of the girls in this book was kind of a turn off. I only ranked it this high on the list because it’s actually pretty good queer rep.

Though it’s ranked this low because there could’ve been ace rep as well, but those hopes were dashed when the romantic couple in the book rushed into being physical.

4/5 Stars

17\. Let’s Talk About Love

The only asexual rep book that made my list (and the only one I could even find this year). Honestly the rep is really good? And it’s not just about romance either, it’s about all types of love. Friends, family, randos you meet on the street. I was very impressed by this book actually.

4.5/5 Stars

16\. Tweet Cute

This book! It was very, *very* cute. A little on the straight side, but I genuinely enjoyed it. It’s about two feuding sandwich companies, one mom and pop, the other a massive chain and the teenagers who run their social media.

And oopsie, they end up falling in love.

4/5 Stars

15\. Ghost Squad

Honestly Chonk is my favourite character to ever exist in anything and Claribel Ortega deserves every award.

5/5 Stars

14\. The Rise of Kyoshi

This was would’ve been higher, but the sequel is sort of blah. I love how it delves deeper into the life of Kyoshi and I *especially* like that it explores her sexuality and sets up more bisexual rep in the Avatar universe. Though I’m struggling really badly through the second book. I’ve borrowed and returned it to my library 3 times.

I’m determined to finish it though. Someday.

4.5/5 Stars

13\. If These Wings Could Fly

This book found me under the guise of your regular, run-of-the-mill high school love story and caught my heart with the magical realism and dark themes. It follows the story of 3 sisters and their escape from an abusive home all while their town becomes infested with crows that are eerily kind to them. It’s such an excellent read.

5/5 Stars

12\. The Midnight Lie

This book made me fall in love with words again. The descriptions and the yearning and the longing made my heart ache. It’s apparently a prequel or sequel or something to a series, but the book stands on its own if you ask me. The ending completely gutted me in the best way. 10/10 would recommend.

5.5/5 Stars

11\. The Disasters

I read this book in a day. It was such a romp through time and Space. It’s incredible to me because this author’s other book (Spell Hacker) ended up on my worst books of the year, but this one was just so much better than I expected. It’s basically a gay romp through space where this rag tag group of Space School Dropouts have to save their friends by doing the exact thing they were told not to do: become a team.

10\. An Absolutely Remarkable Thing by Hank Green

I was not expecting to fall in love with this book as much as I did. I love Science Fiction, but I shy away from Cishet White Male authors writing women and for *good reason* (if you know, *you know*). Hank Green put all my fears to rest within the first few sentences. I was hooked on the unconventional narrative style from the *beginning* and it turned out to be such a good read!

5.7/5 Stars

9\. Call Down the Hawk

What can I even say about this book except for that it ripped my heart out and stomped on it. Ronan and Adam were some of my faves in the original series and to see them again while delving more into Ronan’s family and introducing my one true love Hennessy was a *gift*. And those *seers*? God they’re something otherworldly and straight out of my nightmares. I ***LOVE THEM***.

Though I’m not sure I can ever forgive Maggie for the title of that SEQUEL. ***Yikes***.

5/5 Stars

8\. On The Come Up

I listened to this after I finally moved out of my ex’s house while driving to the beach before quarantine happened. It’s a really happy memory and an excellent book.

7\. A Blade so Black

This is one of the books I feel like I’ve always been waiting for. A rewrite of Alice in Wonderland to make it action packed, queer, vaguely poly, and hella shippy. I read the entire series (that’s out) in a day and a half and I will scream from the rooftops my love for this series forever!

11.7/5 Stars

6\. I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter

This book gutted me. I love the narration and the struggles and the mystery. It felt so real and so true to life and every time a new secret about the family was revealed it was like I hurt with them. Like I shared their pain. This is definitely one of my favourite books of all time not just for 2020.

5\. Clap When You Land

Oh my God. I love everything Acevedo writes, but this one struck me so hard. I love the poetic way she describes the island (Dominican Republic) and the struggles these two strangers (who turn out to be sisters) go through after the death of their father. Everything is both beautiful and painful at the same time. I lock every single one of Acevedo’s words in my heart.

4\. Little Fires Everywhere

3\. Black Girl Unlimited

2\. Crazy Rich Asians
