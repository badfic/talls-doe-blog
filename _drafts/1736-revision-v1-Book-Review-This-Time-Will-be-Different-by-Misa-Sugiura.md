When I read this I was immediately super excited by the idea that this book took place in San Jose. I live about an hour North of there so I always love to read stories about places I’ve visited. Especially when they mention famous places.

In the book they even go to Muir to see the redwoods and honestly, big feels. I remember the first time I saw the California Redwoods. It was utterly breathtaking.

This book really stood out to me because of the discussion of teen pregnancy. I also sort of liked how the story went from past, present, to future and it told more than just CJ’s story, but it also delved deep into Japanese American culture and the activism of teenagers in the 2010’s.

I loved how CJ had a horrible attitude and how big her feelings were. I related to her so much. She kept making all of these mistakes and holding grudges when everyone else kept moving on and going forward. I get that. I get how hard it can be to let things go.

This book was such a good read, but please be aware that you shouldn’t read this if you’re sensitive to topics like abortion and accidental pregnancy.

 Katsuyamas never quit—but seventeen-year-old CJ doesn’t even know where to start. She’s never lived up to her mom’s type A ambition, and she’s perfectly happy just helping her aunt, Hannah, at their family’s flower shop.  
  
She doesn’t buy into Hannah’s romantic ideas about flowers and their hidden meanings, but when it comes to arranging the perfect bouquet, CJ discovers a knack she never knew she had. A skill she might even be proud of.  
  
Then her mom decides to sell the shop—to the family who swindled CJ’s grandparents when thousands of Japanese Americans were sent to internment camps during WWII. Soon a rift threatens to splinter CJ’s family, friends, and their entire Northern California community; and for the first time, CJ has found something she wants to fight for.
