I don’t talk much about them, but I love these suckers.

### **Caspian Garion**

**2-4 songs that are probably on their iPod**

- Through the Fire – Chaka Khan
- Close to You – The Carpenters
- How High the Moon – Ella Fitzgerald
- Le Freak – Chic

**The one place they sometimes end up falling asleep – where they’re not supposed to**

- Usually standing up on his shifts. If he has to stand up in one place for a long time where there isn’t anything going on, he’ll fall asleep. Probably because he doesn’t sleep at night.

**The Game They’d fucking own everyone else at**

- Risk. He’d just be like a fukkin beast at Risk.

**The emoticon they’d use most often**

- ( **͡**° **͜ʖ ͡**°)

**What they act like when they haven’t had enough sleep:**

- A zombie. He doesn’t respond very quickly to anything. He sometimes forgets that he’s talking.

**Their preferred hot beverage on really cold nights. or mornings. or whenever.**

- Decaf strong ginger tea

**how they like to comfort/care for themselves when they’re in a slump**

- Painting tiny models and being obnoxious

**what they wanted to be when they grew up**

- A superhero

**their favorite kind of weather**

- Cold, cloudy, foggy

**thoughts on their singing voice (decent? terrible? soprano? alto?)**

- Alto. Wavery voice. Not terrible, the kind of guy you don’t hear sing usually, but isn’t naturally bad. A little monotonous.

**how/what they like to draw or doodle**

- Weirdly drawn robots, super heroes, spaceships, and tigers.

- - - - - -

- God Bless the Child – Billie Holiday
- Anyone Who Knows What Love Is – Irma Thomas
- No Ordinary Love – Sade
- St. James Infirmary – Cab Calloway

**The one place they sometimes end up falling asleep – where they’re not supposed to**

- Kitchen table. She’s always working on something and falls asleep there working. She doesn’t allow herself to fall asleep anywhere else inappropriate.

**The Game They’d fucking own everyone else at**

- Settlers of Catan. Because she’s a giant NERD.

**The emoticon they’d use most often**

- Only Happy When it Rains – Garbage
- Sexy Naughty Bitchy – Tata Young
- เธอมีฉัน ฉันมีใคร – DA ENDORPHIN

**The one place they sometimes end up falling asleep – where they’re not supposed to**

- Everywhere. She never sleeps at night and she pushes herself until she’s at her limit and just falls asleep wherever she crashes. The most recent weird places being on a roller coaster and in her car with all of the doors open and the keys in the ignition.

**The Game They’d fucking own everyone else at**

- Solitaire. She doesn’t really play games with other people.

**The emoticon they’d use most often**

- 😉 or (ʃƪ¬‿¬)

**What they act like when they haven’t had enough sleep:**

- Completely out of it. Sometimes erratic and hyper, sometimes zoning out to the point where she can lose hours to nonsensical thoughts.

**Their preferred hot beverage on really cold nights. or mornings. or whenever.**

- Hot spiced cinnamon tea.

**How they like to comfort/care for themselves when they’re in a slump**

- She forgets to take care of herself a lot. She’s always been just pushing herself until she can’t anymore.

**What they wanted to be when they grew up**

- She always had a high aptitude for healing, but it’s likely she wanted to be a teacher.

**Their favorite kind of weather**

- Rain. Days, weeks, months where it does nothing but rain. With lightning sometimes.

**Thoughts on their singing voice (decent? terrible? soprano? alto?)**

- Her singing voice is deep and soft and melodic. She isn’t particularly good, but she isn’t bad either.

**How/what they like to draw or doodle**

- Random things like roots and bottles. Anything that’s around her sort of weird still-life things in her notes for potions when she can’t really focus anymore. Lately she’s been drawing a lot of spiders.

**The Game They’d fucking own everyone else at**

- Monopoly

**The emoticon they’d use most often**

- 😐

**What they act like when they haven’t had enough sleep:**

- Snappish and pissy. Really clumsy, hands are very spastic.

**Their preferred hot beverage on really cold nights. or mornings. or whenever.**

- Chai and Coffee together. Forever.

**How they like to comfort/care for themselves when they’re in a slump**

- Perform sketchy magic, usually, experiment with a weird curse that she’s not supposed to do or try to brew a weird potion and see what happens. Mostly just keep herself busy somehow.

**What they wanted to be when they grew up**

- Lion tamer. Or just to work for the circus.

**Their favorite kind of weather**

- She doesn’t really give a shit about the weather. It isn’t a thing that she considers. It just happens to exist.

**Thoughts on their singing voice (decent? terrible? soprano? alto?)**

- Raspy and kind of unsettling.

**How/what they like to draw or doodle**

- She doesn’t ever draw full things, usually just pieces of things like a hand or an eye or a mouth full of teeth or feet. Sometimes she’ll sketch out the basic diagrams of how a set up for a spell or charm is supposed to go.

## **Hecate Crane**

**2-4 songs that are probably on their iPod**

- Definitely the Macarena
- Tequila Song – The Champs
- Waterfalls – TLC

**The one place they sometimes end up falling asleep – where they’re not supposed to**

- Naked on their roof. In full view of Persephone and Violet.

**The Game They’d fucking own everyone else at**

- Strip Poker. She doesn’t give a shit about regular poker, but once it becomes strip poker she’s really fukkin good at that game. She also throws these huge lavish parties where like 900 trillion uni students attend. Lots of strip poker those nights.

**The emoticon they’d use most often**

- :3c

**What they act like when they haven’t had enough sleep:**

- A gardener. She just wanted to grow flowers and fruits and vegetables.

**Their favorite kind of weather**

- Sunshiny. Not humid. Not too hot. But WARM.

**Thoughts on their singing voice (decent? terrible? soprano? alto?)**

- She sounds fucking amazing. An amazing smoky, very vibrato jazz singer type voice.

**How/what they like to draw or doodle**

- Dicks. Everywhere. On your car. On your cow. On your mom.
