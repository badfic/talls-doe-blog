Yeah. She only has the one sister. Persephone.

**What is/was your character’s relationship with their mother like?**

She doesn’t remember her.

**What is/was your character’s relationship with their father like?**

She doesn’t remember him.

**Has your character ever witnessed something that fundamentally changed them? If so, does anyone else know?**

Not that she knows of. (bwahahaha)

**On an average day, what can be found in your character’s pockets?**

Her phone. She carries a bag for everything else.

**Does your character have recurring themes in their dreams?**

Hahaha. Sure, if you call hallucinating on “love potions” dreams.

**Does your character have recurring themes in their nightmares?**

Yes.

**Has your character ever fired a gun? If so, what was their first target?**

No.

**Is your character’s current socioeconomic status different than it was when they were growing up?**

She was comfortable as a kid and she’s comfortable now.

**Does your character feel more comfortable with more clothing, or with less clothing?**

Violet wears a normal amount of clothing. She isn’t super into swimming so she probably never wears bikinis, However she’s thinking about it. She does wear a lot of weird revealing clothing to push boundaries with Jasmine, though.

**In what situation was your character the most afraid they’ve ever been?**

Spoilers~

**In what situation was your character the most calm they’ve ever been?**

Probably finally realizing what she wanted for her life.

**Is your character bothered by the sight of blood? If so, in what way?**

Lol, *NO*. Wixen/Casters regularly use blood casting in day to day life. She literally draws runes on her arms in her own blood.

**Does your character remember names or faces easier?**

Violet doesn’t care to remember people who aren’t interesting.

**Is your character preoccupied with money or material possession? Why or why not?**

Um?? No??

**Which does your character idealize most: happiness or success?**

Both.

**What was your character’s favorite toy as a child?**

She has a hard time remembering playing much as a kid. Her parents died in a fire when she was very young and a lot of those memories of them are missing now. When she was in boarding school she mostly read hand me down books and by the time she was 9, they were looking at her for advanced medical casting. When she was 12 she joined the junior medical corps and began learning a set of specialized runes and techniques for surgery.

She didn’t have much of a childhood.

**Is your character more likely to admire wisdom, or ambition in others?**

Kindness. Above all, she admires kindness.

**What is your character’s biggest relationship flaw? Has this flaw destroyed relationships for them before?**

Most Casters have issues in relationships. Violet is no exception. She doesn’t know how to act around someone she likes. That translates differently for different people, Violet tends to get violent and freak out *a lot*.

**In what ways does your character compare themselves to others? Do they do this for the sake of self-validation, or self-criticism?**

Hm. That’s a good question. Violet tends to compare her fashion sense to others and can get jealous when someone dresses more glam goth than her. Though, that’s how she met her best friend Tiffany.

**If something tragic or negative happens to your character, do they believe they may have caused or deserved it, or are they quick to blame others?**

She mostly pretends it didn’t happen, but she does beat herself up a lot about Idaho.

**What does your character like in other people?**

k i n d n e s s and u n d e r s t a n d i n g.

**What does your character dislike in other people?**

fuckbois.

**How quick is your character to trust someone else?**

No.

**How quick is your character to suspect someone else? Does this change if they are close with that person?**

Yes.

She doesn’t have an opinion on children. (Yet).

**How does your character normally deal with confrontation?**

Murder.

**How quick or slow is your character to resort to physical violence in a confrontation?**

Uhhh. A normal amount?

**What did your character dream of being or doing as a child? Did that dream come true?**

She’s always been a smart little brat. She wanted to do something to help people. She understood from a young age what being magically inclined meant. And no, her dream hasn’t come true.

**What does your character find repulsive or disgusting?**

Delivery services.

**Describe a scenario in which your character feels most comfortable.**

Uh. Writing in her potions journal.

**Describe a scenario in which your character feels most uncomfortable.**

Hm. Probably when people think sawing bones makes a “crunching” sound and not a “popping” one. She’s very disgusted by people’s lack of medical knowledge. As a medical professional herself.

**In the face of criticism, is your character defensive, self-deprecating, or willing to improve?**

Willing to improve most definitely.

**How does your character behave around people they like?**

Terribly.

**How does your character behave around people they dislike?**

By not killing them and merely ignoring them because murdering everyone she dislikes is a GOOD WAY TO GET ARRESTED.

**Is your character more concerned with defending their honor, or protecting their status?**

Uh. Neither.

**Is your character more likely to remove a problem/threat, or remove themselves from a problem/threat?**

Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Both.

**Has your character ever been bitten by an animal? How were they affected (or unaffected)?**

Uh. I don’t think she’s been in a situation where this could have happened. She has, however, been bitten by several humanoids and magical creatures seeking medical treatment.

**How does your character treat people in service jobs?**

like regular people.

**Does your character feel that they deserve to have what they want, whether it be material or abstract, or do they feel they must earn it first?**

Sure?

Definitely. Hecate 4 ever.

Yes. Her best friend Tiffany.

**How easy or difficult is it for your character to say “I love you?” Can they say it without meaning it?**

LOL.

**What does your character believe will happen to them after they die? Does this belief scare them?**

She believes what every Wixen believes, that their bodies become energy and return to the leylines.
